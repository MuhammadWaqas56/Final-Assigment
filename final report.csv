Residents described heavy bombing, with the Israeli strikes hitting several houses and mosques.  The Israeli military said it struck “terror targets” in part of Rafah, and that the strikes coincided with a mission that rescued two Israeli hostages who were being held by Hamas militants.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the operation, saying Israel “will not miss any opportunity” to bring home hostages held in Gaza.  “Only continued military pressure, until total victory, will bring the release of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a statement.  More than four months of war, and repeated Israeli evacuation orders have pushed Palestinian civilians farther and farther south, with many living in tent camps and overcrowded U.N. shelters in the Rafah area.

Meinie Nicolai, director-general of medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, called Monday for Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah and for other countries to “take concrete action” to bring a sustained cease-fire.  “Nowhere in Gaza is safe, and repeated forced displacements have pushed people to Rafah, where they are trapped in a tiny patch of land and have no options,” Nicolai said in a statement.  U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to Netanyahu by phone Sunday and told him Israel shouldn’t go forward with a military operation in Rafah without “a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there,” a White House statement said.  Netanyahu on Sunday promised “safe passage” for tens of thousands of Palestinians out of Rafah ahead of a planned Israeli ground offensive against Hamas militants.   It was not clear, however, where the displaced Palestinians could go.   Netanyahu, in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” show, reiterated his intention to order Israeli troops to attack four Hamas battalions in Rafah, saying victory cannot be achieved over the militants in Gaza without clearing them out of the town on the Egyptian border.                         SEE ALSO:      Israel Discovers Hamas Tunnels Under UNRWA Gaza Headquarters            When asked where the Palestinians — many already sheltering in makeshift tents — would go, Netanyahu said only that Israeli officials are ""working out a detailed plan.""  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there would be the risk of a ""gigantic tragedy"" if the Israel Defense Forces expand their offensive into Rafah.  “We would not support in any way forced displacement, which goes against international law,” Guterres’ spokesperson told reporters Friday about a potential evacuation of Rafah.  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote on social media platform X, ""The people in Gaza cannot disappear into thin air,"" adding that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be a ""humanitarian catastrophe in the making.""  Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry warned Saturday of ""very serious repercussions of storming and targeting"" Rafah and called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the prospective offensive.  ""The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out,"" he wrote on X.                  Smoke billows during Israeli bombardment over Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Feb. 12, 2024 amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group.        An Israeli ground offensive into Rafah could have other repercussions as well.  Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television quoted a senior Hamas official as saying any Israeli ground offensive into Rafah would ""blow up"" negotiations for a halt in the fighting and the possible release of about 100 hostages held by the militants.  Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, Britain and the European Union. The war in Gaza started with the October Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and led to the capture of 240 hostages, about 100 of whom were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November. Hamas health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 28,300 people.  Egyptian officials have warned that any ground operation in Rafah or mass displacement across the border would undermine its 40-year-old peace treaty with Israel.  It is also the main humanitarian aid entry point to Gaza and intense fighting could further hamper relief efforts.  Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, warned that any Israeli ground offensive on Rafah would have “disastrous consequences,” claiming that Israel aims to eventually force the Palestinians out of their land.  The dire humanitarian situation has sparked Arab and U.N. concerns that Palestinians may eventually be driven over the border.  Egypt has sent about 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers to northeastern Sinai within the past two weeks as part of a series of measures to bolster security on its border with Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.

The Associated Press, citing health officials and eyewitnesses, reported at least 44 people were killed — including more than a dozen children — when airstrikes hit several homes in the Rafah area.  Netanyahu’s office said Friday the military was ordered to develop a plan to evacuate civilians in Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it said were deployed there.  “It is impossible to achieve the goal of the war of eliminating Hamas by leaving four Hamas battalions in Rafah,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “On the contrary, it is clear that intense activity in Rafah requires that civilians evacuate the areas of combat.  Netanyahu did not provide details or a timeline for the Israeli offensive, but the announcement created widespread panic.   More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people are packed into Rafah, many after evacuating two-thirds of Gaza's territory. It's not clear where these people could find shelter next.  Netanyahu said this week that Rafah and the city of Khan Younis are the ""two last strongholds of Hamas."" Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., the U.K. and the EU.

Egypt has sent about 40 tanks and armored personnel carriers to northeastern Sinai within the past two weeks as part of a series of measures to bolster security on its border with Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.  Meanwhile, Syria said Israeli airstrikes Saturday hit several sites outside the capital, Damascus. State media quoted Syrian military officials as saying the strikes came from the direction of Israeli-held Golan Heights. The Britain-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed in the strikes.  The strikes come as tensions across the Middle East have intensified following the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel and a drone attack in January that killed three U.S. soldiers in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border.  U.S. warning   Netanyahu’s announcement came hours after U.S. President Joe Biden delivered some of his strongest criticism yet of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, calling Israel’s conduct in the military operation “over the top” during a news conference late Thursday.

The statement did not say by when he wanted the plan or to where he thought the more than 1.4 million Palestinians could evacuate. United Nations officials have repeatedly said nowhere in Gaza is safe.  Netanyahu said this week that Rafah and the city of Khan Younis are the ""two last strongholds of Hamas."" Hamas is a U.S.-designated terror group.  Rafah borders Egypt, and officials there have warned that any ground operation in the area or mass displacement across the border would undermine its 40-year-old peace treaty with Israel.

Israel launched new strikes overnight in Rafah, which witnesses and hospital officials said killed at least eight people, including women and children.

Women and children queue for water in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Feb. 9, 2024.        Washington is also concerned that an invasion of Rafah could have a spillover effect into Egypt.  ""What could happen here with the relationship with Egypt? What will happen if the Palestinians try and rush into Egypt?” said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Political Studies Department at Bar-Ilan University.  “How are you going to deal with that? Those are the kinds of questions that are being asked” by the U.S. to the Israelis, he told VOA.  Despite its increasingly blunt public warnings to Israel, the U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel's military campaign to eliminate Hamas.  The White House has said it is optimistic that there is still a path toward a temporary cease-fire. Next week, Biden is set to meet with Jordan's King Abdullah as part of his push for a cease-fire and hostage release deal.  Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, warned that a deal may be elusive because ""neither Hamas nor the Israelis right now are really interested.""  ""There's no urgency for either of them in a comprehensive sort of cessation of hostilities,"" he said. ""The only people that appear to be in a hurry is the Biden administration.""  The U.N.’s top Middle East diplomat, Tor Wennesland, warned this week that a cease-fire is urgent before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10, otherwise tensions could further boil over in Jerusalem around holy sites.

https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-israeli-officials-discuss-efforts-to-free-hostages-held-in-gaza-/7479145.html,  Blinken Heads Home Without Israeli-Hamas Cease-Fire or Hostage Release  ,"      February 08, 2024 4:36 AM        update    February 08, 2024 11:04 AM      ",  By Nike Ching  ,"  State Department —   U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Washington from the Middle East on Thursday with no new deal in hand for a cease-fire in the four-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza or release of any more hostages held by the militants.  Blinken and other U.S. officials said they remained optimistic a halt in the fighting can be achieved and 100 or so remaining hostages freed. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu derided a Hamas plan that would leave the militants in control of the Gaza Strip as “delusional” and said Israeli forces would fight to win “absolute victory.”  Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Joe Biden would host Jordan's King Abdullah II in Washington on Monday for talks on resolving the Israel-Hamas conflict.  Blinken wrapped up a four-nation Mideast trip by meeting with Netanyahu’s war cabinet, including former military chiefs Benny Gantz and Gabi Eisenkot. The top U.S. diplomat said he would focus on “the hostages and the strong desire that we both have to see them returned to their families, the work that's being done to that end.”                         SEE ALSO:      Blinken Pushes for Israel-Hamas Cease-Fire During Doha Talks            But late Wednesday, Blinken acknowledged sharp differences between a cease-fire plan offered by Israel, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt that would last several weeks and free hostages and Hamas’ response calling for an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, an end to its bombardment of Gaza and the right for Hamas to govern the territory and rebuild its military capability.  ""Clearly there are things that Hamas sent back that are absolute non-starters,"" Blinken said at a news conference. ""But, at the same time, we see space to continue to pursue an agreement.”  ""And these things are always negotiations,” he said. “It's not flipping a light switch. It's not 'yes' or 'no.' There's invariably back and forth.""  A senior Hamas official said a Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Thursday to continue negotiations with Egyptian and Qatari officials.   The United States has been Israel’s staunchest ally in its fight against Hamas following the militants’ shock October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. But Netanyahu was dismissive of Blinken’s assessment that the Hamas’ plan could at least serve as a starting point for cease-fire discussions.  “We are on the way to an absolute victory. There is no other solution,” Netanyahu said at a news conference after meeting with Blinken. He said Israel’s war effort would take months, not years.   The Israeli leader also appeared to dismiss concerns from the U.S. and others about expanding Israel's military operations in southern Gaza, particularly in Rafah on the Egyptian border, where more than a million Palestinians have fled at Israel’s demand to escape fighting further to the north.  Blinken said, ""On all of my previous visits here and pretty much every day in between, we have pressed Israel in concrete ways to strengthen civilian protection, to get more assistance to those who need it. And over the past four months, Israel has taken important steps to do just that,"" he said. ""And yet … the daily toll that its military operations continue to take on innocent civilians remains too high.""  In rejecting the Hamas cease-fire plan, Netanyahu also called for the dismantlement of the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, the main distributor of international humanitarian assistance in Gaza, after allegations that a dozen of its employees took part in the Hamas October attack.   Blinken appealed to Netanyahu and other Israelis not to let vengeance dictate their continued response.  ""Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,"" he said. ""And the hostages have been dehumanized every day since. But that cannot be a license to dehumanize others.""                    Palestinian women mourn over the wrapped body of a relative killed in overnight Israeli bombardment on the southern Gaza Strip at Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah on Feb. 8, 2024.        The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry says Israel’s counter-offensive has killed more than 27,500 people and displaced about 2 million Palestinians in Gaza from their homes.   In its proposal, Hamas called for three 45-day phases, first releasing all remaining women and children, as well as older and sick men, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.   The Hamas plan calls for Israel to withdraw from populated areas and end its aerial bombardment while also allowing far more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and permitting Palestinians to return to their homes, including in devastated northern Gaza.   The second phase, to be negotiated during the first, would include the release of all remaining hostages, mostly soldiers, in exchange for all Palestinian detainees over the age of 50, including senior militants, to be freed by Israel.  Israel would release an additional 1,500 prisoners, 500 of whom would be specified by Hamas, and complete its withdrawal from Gaza.   In the third phase, the sides would exchange the remains of hostages and prisoners. Israel says it believes more than two dozen of the remaining 130 or so hostages in Gaza have already died or been killed.   Blinken’s trip to the Mideast was his fifth since the war started.  He has reiterated the U.S, stance that creation of a Palestinian state is the best way to ensure lasting peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, and greater integration for the region. According to the State Department, Blinken also emphasized the urgent need to lower tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and prevent the conflict from expanding.   Critics have attacked Netanyahu for having no definitive plan for governing Gaza after the war ends.   He said Wednesday, ""The day after is the day after Hamas. All of Hamas.""  Netanyahu has rejected any arrangement that would leave Hamas in full or partial control of Gaza. He also said Israel is the “only power” capable of guaranteeing security in the long term.

The Israeli leader ruled out an offer by Hamas for an end to four months of fighting accompanied by a staged, 4½-month release of about 100 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

And we will work at that relentlessly until we get there.""    Blinken did not specify the ""nonstarters"" in the Hamas response. However, when asked if the U.S. would accept a role for Hamas in governing Gaza in the aftermath of the conflict, he stated that the short answer is no.  The top U.S. diplomat is on his fifth round of talks with Mideast leaders in a so-far fruitless effort to end the warfare that erupted with the October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. Hamas health officials in Gaza say Israel’s counter-offensive has killed more than 27,500 and displaced about 2 million Gazans from their homes.  Blinken held talks Wednesday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah and with senior Israeli national security leaders, including Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.  Blinken reiterated U.S. support for the establishment of a Palestinian state as the best way to ensure lasting peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike, and greater integration for the region. According to the State Department, Blinken also emphasized the urgent need to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank and prevent the conflict from expanding.                  Palestinians react at the site of an Israeli strike on a car, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 7, 2024.        Netanyahu has rejected any arrangement that would leave Hamas in full or partial control of Gaza. He also said Israel is the ""only power"" capable of guaranteeing security in the long term. The U.S. has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Netanyahu has also rejected.  While some Netanyahu critics inside Israel and abroad have criticized him for having no definitive plan to govern Gaza when the war ends, he said bluntly, ""The day after is the day after Hamas. All of Hamas.""  Martin Griffiths, United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said that more than half of Gaza's population is currently crammed in Rafah, a town originally home to 250,000 people situated right at Egypt's border.  ""Their living conditions are abysmal — they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death,"" he said.  A senior Hamas official announced that a Hamas delegation would travel to Cairo on Thursday to continue the negotiation and pursue cease-fire talks with Egyptian and Qatari officials.                  Israeli activists set up tents for blocking trucks carrying humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza, in southern Israel, Feb. 7, 2024.        In its proposal, Hamas called for three 45-day phases, first releasing all remaining women and children, as well as older and sick men, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.  The Hamas plan calls for Israel to withdraw from populated areas and end its aerial bombardment while also allowing far more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and permitting Palestinians to return to their homes, including in devastated northern Gaza.  The second phase, to be negotiated during the first, would include the release of all remaining hostages, mostly soldiers, in exchange for all Palestinian detainees over the age of 50, including senior militants, to be freed by Israel.  Israel would release an additional 1,500 prisoners, 500 of whom would be specified by Hamas, and complete its withdrawal from Gaza.  In the third phase, the sides would exchange the remains of hostages and prisoners. Israel says it believes more than two dozen of the remaining 130 or so hostages in Gaza have already died or been killed.  A previous temporary cease-fire in late November lasted for a week and brought the release of more than 100 hostages from Gaza and 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The Israeli military said Tuesday that 31 of the remaining hostages are dead.

Currently, the only way for journalists to enter the Gaza Strip is by embedding with the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF. But that access is restricted and risks skewing an audience’s understanding of the conflict, according to some reporters and analysts.  “It’s incredibly frustrating that we don’t have more access to Gaza,” Steve Hendrix, Jerusalem bureau chief for The Washington Post, told VOA.  “But they’re not budging. They’re not letting anybody in except in these very strict, very controlled, guided tours,” Hendrix said, referring to the IDF.  Others say that the restrictions on access risk providing an imbalanced picture to international audiences.  “They are shown what the army wants them to see, and then they leave,” Nour Odeh, a Palestinian political analyst, told VOA from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.  Up until the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, journalists could enter Gaza with credentials from Israel’s Government Press Office and permission from Hamas, which governs Gaza.  Israeli journalists — and nationals in general — are not permitted to enter Gaza, and neither are Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank.  But since October 7, journalists looking to report from Gaza are able to enter only if they embed with the IDF and agree to conditions, including to not wander from the IDF tour and to submit coverage for prepublication approval by the military.  “The army has full control over who goes in, where you go and what you see,” said Josef Federman, the longtime news director for Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan at The Associated Press.  At least 85 journalists killed  To date, the only exception has been CNN’s Clarissa Ward, who in December entered Gaza via Rafah without an IDF escort.  Hamas, meanwhile, has never offered embeds, reporters say, and typically blocked journalists from covering the group’s military activity.  The IDF did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment.  But Lior Haiat, the spokesperson of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, told VOA that Hamas “is manipulating information of civilians and reporters.”  Haiat claimed that nearly half of the reporters that Hamas has said were killed by Israel “were actually terrorists.”  As of February 6, at least 85 journalists have been killed since the war began, according to investigations by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. They are part of the overall death toll of around 26,000 people in Gaza and 1,200 in Israel.                         SEE ALSO:      Israel-Hamas War Takes 'Record Toll' on Journalists, Press Freedom            It’s common for militaries to impose restrictions on journalists when embedding, analysts say, such as agreeing to not report on troop movements or weapons capabilities. But the IDF’s restrictions are harsher than normal, they said.  Those who are in favor of embedding told VOA that while it doesn’t allow the access they would like, they believe limited access is better than none.  “The question we have to ask ourselves is, is the freedom to report that we give up counterbalanced by the rare opportunity to get our own eyes on even part of the situation there?” Hendrix said.  Hendrix embedded with the IDF in Gaza in November and said he convinced the military to waive its prepublication censorship stipulation for him.  'Whole thing is so highly controlled'  But to Federman, getting out of that requirement is a small win, because “the whole thing is so highly controlled.”  As a journalist based in Israel for two decades, Federman still believes embedding is worth it.  “Right now, we’re in a period of very imperfect access. So, it’s better than nothing. It’s far from ideal,” said Federman, who is also a board member of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem.  In December, the journalist association filed a petition with Israel’s Supreme Court requesting the court to grant reporters independent access into Gaza. The court rejected the appeal in January.  Kelly McBride, chair of the Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute, said she sees little value in embedding.  “This is more like a staged theater event than it is a genuine look at what’s going on,” McBride told VOA from St. Petersburg, Florida.                         SEE ALSO:      Israel Ranks Among World’s Worst Jailers of Journalists, Report Finds            If journalists do embed, McBride said, it’s important to be upfront with audiences about what restrictions they experienced.  “You should let the audience know, ‘Hey, I’m looking through this window that the military gave me,’” she said.  Issues around embeds are not particularly new, according to Subramaniam Vincent, director of journalism and media ethics at Santa Clara University.  In the Israel-Hamas war, but also more broadly, Vincent said it’s important for journalists to recognize that militaries have their own reasons for letting journalists embed.  “They see control of the narrative as a tool,” Vincent said. “They look at the media as a strategic tool for the conflict and for power.”  It falls on reporters to make sure they don’t become a tool for the military, said Dalia Hatuqa, a freelance journalist based between Ramallah and Amman, Jordan.  She said there could be value in embedding as long as the journalist is prepared to hold the IDF accountable and ask tough questions. But too often, that coverage “takes the word of the Israeli army as gospel,” Hatuqa said.  “There’s always that fear that you could become a propaganda mouthpiece,” she said.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-conducts-airstrikes-on-rafah/7483633.html,  Funeral Held for Al Jazeera Journalist Killed in Israel Strike  ,"      December 16, 2023 7:28 PM      ",  By Agence France-Presse  ,"  Dozens of journalists took part in a funeral on Saturday for an Al Jazeera cameraman killed in an Israeli strike in the south of the war-torn Gaza Strip.   Samer Abu Daqqa's body, bearing his bullet-proof vest and helmet, was carried through a crowd in the city of Khan Yunis before being buried in a grave dug by fellow journalists.   His mother Umm Maher Abu Daqqa accused Israel of targeting journalists, ""especially those working for Al Jazeera.""   IDF doesn't want press, says journalist  Abu Daqqa, born in 1978, was reporting from a school in Khan Younis when he was hit by a drone strike on Friday, said the Qatar-based Al Jazeera television network.   His colleague, Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh, was wounded in the same attack. Dahdouh had lost his wife and two children in a separate Israeli strike in the initial weeks of the war.   Dahdouh told AFP the Israeli army ""deliberately"" targeted journalists in Gaza, adding it ""does not want the press.""   ""There was only the Al Jazeera team and the civil defense in the area,"" he said.   The Israeli army told AFP it took ""operationally feasible measures"" to protect both civilians and journalists in Gaza.   ""Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks,"" it said.   Three members of the civil defense force were also killed in the strike and their funerals were held on Saturday, AFP correspondents reported.   Al Jazeera says Israel kept aid from injured journalist   On Friday, Al Jazeera said it held ""Israel accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families.""   ""Following Samer's injury, he was left to bleed to death for over five hours, as Israeli forces prevented ambulances and rescue workers from reaching him, denying the much-needed emergency treatment,"" it said in a statement.   The Israeli army said it approved a route for a Palestinian ambulance to access the scene but the medical van chose another route and was blocked.   More than 60 journalists and media staff have died since the start of the war between Hamas and Israel on October 7, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.   On Saturday, the Emirati TV channel Al Mashhad said its correspondent Muhammad Baalousha ""was injured by an Israeli sniper in the Gaza Strip,"" condemning it as an ""attack on press freedom.""   The channel said in a statement that it was trying ""to evacuate its correspondent"" after he sustained the gunshot wound.   The war began after Hamas militants launched an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7 that killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.   Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring home an estimated 250 hostages abducted by militants to Gaza, Israel launched a massive offensive that has left much of the besieged territory in ruins.   The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says the war has killed at least 18,800 people, mostly women and children in the Palestinian territory.   "
https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-admits-mistakenly-killing-3-israeli-hostages-in-gaza-/7400543.html,  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv Demand Israeli Government Negotiate Hostages' Release  ,"      December 15, 2023 8:36 PM        update    December 16, 2023 2:50 PM      ",  By VOA News  ,"  Several hundred families, friends and supporters of Israeli hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza rallied Saturday in Tel Aviv at the ""Hostages Plaza,"" calling on the Israeli government to negotiate the hostages' release.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the hostages' deaths an ""unbearable tragedy"" and vowed to continue ""with a supreme effort to return all the hostages home safely.""   The army's chief spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Israeli troops erroneously identified the hostages as a threat and fired on them Friday as they were coming out of a building waving a white flag to show that they were posing no threat.   He said it was not clear whether the hostages had escaped their captors or had been abandoned. Their deaths occurred in Gaza's Sheijaia, the scene of bloody battles between Israel's military and Hamas militants. Hagari said the army expressed ""deep sorrow"" and is investigating.   After the first two hostages were shot, the third young man ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. The commander issued an order to cease fire, but another burst of gunfire killed the third man, an Israeli military official said.   According to a preliminary investigation, the soldiers who followed the third hostage into the building believed he was a Hamas member trying to pull them into a trap, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.   The soldiers' behavior was ""against our rules of engagement,"" the military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. He noted the incident was being investigated at the highest level.   The account of how the hostages died raises questions about the conduct of Israeli ground troops. Palestinians on several occasions have reported that Israeli soldiers opened fire as civilians tried to flee to safety.   Hamas has claimed other hostages were previously killed by Israeli gunfire or airstrikes, without presenting evidence.   Intense fighting continued Saturday in Gaza between Israeli forces and the U.S.- and EU-designated terror group Hamas — despite urgings from U.S. officials for Israel to use more precise targeting of Hamas leaders in Gaza, rather than widespread bombing and ground operations.   Residents in northern Gaza reported heavy bombing and the sounds of gunbattles overnight and into Saturday in Gaza City and the nearby urban refugee camp of Jabaliya.   Airstrikes and tank shelling overnight also were reported in the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Palestinian media said Saturday dozens of Palestinians were killed in the airstrikes.   The Israeli army said Saturday it had raided two schools in Gaza City, saying they were a Hamas hiding place. On Friday, the military said its troops had destroyed a Hamas command-and-control hub in Gaza's Sheijaia district and conducted a ""targeted raid"" on militant infrastructure in Khan Younis.

""There will be a transition to another phase of this war, one that is focused in more precise ways on targeting the leadership and on intelligence-driven operations,"" he told reporters Friday following two days of meetings with Israeli officials.                  A Palestinian reacts after an Israeli strike on residential buildings in Rafah, Gaza, on Dec. 15, 2023.        So far, the Israel Defense Forces have resisted increasing global pressure to curb the Gaza offensive.  Sullivan also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday. During the meeting, Abbas called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and increased aid for the enclave.  The Middle East has been a tinderbox since Iranian-backed Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,200 people while taking about 240 people hostage, according to Israel. Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground offensive have killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.  While reiterating U.S. support for Israel and its military response to the deadly Hamas attack against Israel two months ago, U.S. President Joe Biden and other officials have expressed concern about the number of civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.   Israel has defended its tactics, saying it is taking unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties, such as ordering people to evacuate areas where it plans to carry out military operations.   Israel's military also has blamed Hamas for intentionally operating in populated areas.   The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency says nearly 1.9 million people, about 85% of Gaza's population, have been forced from their homes, with more than 1.1 million currently registered at the agency's shelters in central and southern Gaza. The agency said the average shelter is nine times over its intended capacity.   VOA White House Correspondent Anita Powell contributed to this report.

https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-americans-sue-biden-administration-over-relatives-stuck-in-gaza-/7400521.html,  Palestinian Americans Sue Biden Administration Over Relatives Stuck in Gaza   ,"      December 15, 2023 7:42 PM      ",  By Reuters  ,"  washington —   Two Palestinian American families have sued the Biden administration, saying the government has not done as much to evacuate their U.S. relatives stuck in Gaza as it did for Israeli dual nationals.   In the days after Hamas' October 7 assault in southern Israel, the U.S. government organized charter flights from Tel Aviv to Europe to help Americans leave Israel after many airlines canceled service to the country.   The State Department says it has helped around 1,300 U.S. Palestinians leave Gaza and escape Israel's retaliatory bombardment — in part by coordinating their exit to neighboring Egypt with Israeli and Egyptian authorities.   But the United States has not taken steps to organize dedicated flights or otherwise help secure the exit of an estimated 900 U.S. citizens, residents and family members who remain trapped in Gaza, the American families suing the government say.   They say this violates their constitutional rights.   ""There is more that the U.S. government can do, and they are choosing not to do it for Palestinians,"" Yasmeen Elagha, who has family stuck in Gaza and helped organize the lawsuit, said in an interview.   The State Department declined to comment on pending litigation, but a spokesperson said the department is working to get more Americans and family members out of Gaza. The White House referred questions on the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not immediately comment.   Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israeli border communities with Gaza and took 240 hostages during their October 7 assault, according to Israeli tallies.  Since then, Israeli bombardment has killed nearly 19,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. According to U.N. estimates, up to 85% of the 2.3 million people in the densely populated enclave have been displaced from their homes.   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, accuses the federal government of failing to protect U.S. citizens in an active war zone and denying equal protection to Palestinian Americans, a right under the U.S. Constitution.   The suit seeks to force the government to begin evacuation efforts and secure the safety of its citizens ""on equal terms to other noncombatants in the same war zone.""   Two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Elagha's cousins, Borak Alagha and Hashem Alagha, U.S. citizens who were studying engineering in the Palestinian coastal enclave.   Americans listed by the United States as wanting to leave Gaza at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing must be approved by both Israel and Egypt.   The three Americans cited in the lawsuit have not been cleared to leave, said Elagha, who lives near Chicago.   Maria Kari, a lawyer with the Arab American Civil Rights League who represents the plaintiffs, said her organization filed about 40 lawsuits in the first month of the conflict on behalf of Palestinian dual nationals.   ""We're simply asking the Biden administration to do something it already did for a class of citizens in the same war,"" she said.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-army-opens-probe-into-killing-of-2-palestinians-at-close-range-/7400256.html,  Israeli Army Opens Probe Into Killing of 2 Palestinians at Close Range  ,"      December 15, 2023 6:42 PM      ",  By Associated Press  ,"  jerusalem —   Israel on Friday said it was opening a military police investigation into the killing of two Palestinians in the West Bank after an Israeli human rights group posted videos that appeared to show Israeli troops killing the men — one who was incapacitated and the second unarmed — during a military raid in a West Bank refugee camp.  The B’Tselem human rights group accused the army of carrying out a pair of “illegal executions.”  The security camera videos show two Israeli military vehicles pursuing a group of Palestinians in the Faraa refugee camp in the northern West Bank. One man, who appears to be holding a red canister, is gunned down by soldiers. B'Tselem identified the man as 25-year-old Rami Jundob.  The military jeep then approaches Jundob as he lies bleeding on the ground and fires multiple shots at him until he is still. Soldiers then approach a man identified by B'Tselem as 36-year-old Thaar Shahin as he cowers underneath the hood of a car. They shoot at him from close range.  B’Tselem said that Shahin was killed instantly and Jundob died of his wounds the next day.  Israel's military said its military police unit opened an investigation into the December 8 shootings “on the suspicion that during the incident, shots were fired not in accordance with the law.” It said that the findings would be referred to a military prosecutor, an indication that criminal charges could be filed.  Israel rarely prosecutes such cases, and human rights groups say soldiers rarely receive serious punishments even if wrongdoing is found. In a high-profile case, an Israeli soldier was convicted of manslaughter and served a reduced nine-month sentence in jail after shooting a badly wounded Palestinian who was lying on the ground in 2016.  The army recently opened an investigation into a soldier who shot and killed an Israeli man who had just killed a pair of Palestinian attackers at a Jerusalem bus stop. The soldier apparently suspected the Israeli was also an assailant — despite kneeling on the ground, raising his hands and opening his shirt to show he wasn't a threat. The shooting underscored what critics say is an epidemic of excessive force by Israeli soldiers, police and armed citizens against suspected Palestinian attackers.  In a separate incident Friday, police said they had suspended officers caught on video beating up a Palestinian photojournalist in east Jerusalem. The photojournalist was identified on social media as Mustafa Haruf, who works for the Turkish news agency Anadolu.  In the video, one officer approaches Haruf and strikes him with the butt of his gun while another officer pushes him against a car. One points his gun at Haruf and another pulls him to the ground in a headlock. An officer kneels on Haruf's body, the other officer kicking Haruf repeatedly in the head as he screams in pain.  Other officers stand by, watching and pushing back shocked onlookers.  “The Border Police Command views the conduct of these officers as inconsistent with the values of the force,” the police said in a statement as it announced the suspensions of the officers and an investigation.  Both incidents come as tensions in the West Bank and east Jerusalem have been inflamed by the war between Israel and Hamas, with Israelis on edge and bracing for further attacks. Palestinians and human rights groups have long accused Israeli forces of using excessive force and skirting accountability.  Since the outbreak of war, violence in the West Bank from Israeli forces and settlers has reached record levels. Since October 7, 287 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. That's the deadliest year on record in the West Bank in 18 years, it said.  "

""The conditions and the timing for that was obviously a subject of conversation I had"" with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, other Israeli government leaders and military commanders.

Their deaths occurred in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah, the scene of bloody battles against Hamas militants. He said the army expressed ""deep sorrow"" and is investigating.  Israeli defense chief Yoav Gallant told Sullivan on Thursday it will take ""more than several months"" to destroy Hamas, which he said has been building its infrastructure “under the ground and above the ground"" in Gaza for more than a decade.  ""But we will win, and we will destroy them,"" Gallant said.  Sullivan declined to answer when asked Friday whether the U.S. would hold back military aid if Israel does not reduce civilian casualties, saying the best way to reach an agreement was in private discussions.                  Palestinians mourn relatives killed in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip outside a morgue in Khan Younis on Dec. 15, 2023.        Sullivan also said after meeting with Netanyahu and Gallant in Tel Aviv that Israel's efforts to crush Hamas must not lead to a long-term Israeli occupation of the territory. He said the United States believes it neither makes sense nor is right for Israel to reoccupy Gaza over the long term.  So far, the Israel Defense Forces have resisted increasing global pressure to curb its Gaza offensive.  The Middle East has been a tinderbox since Iranian-backed Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,200 people while taking about 240 people hostage, by Israeli count. Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground offensive have killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.  West Bank violence  Twelve European nations joined by Australia, Canada and the European Union have called on Israel ""to take immediate and concrete steps to tackle record high settler violence in the occupied West Bank.""  In a joint statement released Friday by the Swedish government, the countries expressed ""their grave concern about the record number of attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.""  ""The rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians is unacceptable,"" the statement said. ""Israel, as the occupying power, must protect the Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank.""  The joint statement also said that ""those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice"" and that the violence ""undermines security in the West Bank and the region and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.""  The European countries are Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  Fierce fighting  Fighting in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas raged on Friday. The Israeli military said its troops had destroyed a Hamas command-and-control hub in Gaza's Sheijaia district and conducted a ""targeted raid"" on militant infrastructure in Khan Younis.                  Smoke rises from town of Khan Younis after Israeli strikes on Dec. 15, 2023.        The Israel Defense Forces also said its soldiers have recovered the bodies of two soldiers and one civilian hostage taken in the Hamas terror attack on October 7.  Urban warfare in Gaza is also proving deadly for the Israeli troops. About 110 Israeli soldiers have been killed as tanks and infantry advance into the cities and refugee camps, based on official Israeli figures. About a quarter were tank crew.  According to Israeli military experts and a Hamas source, Hamas, a U.S.- and EU-designated terrorist group, has used a large weapons stockpile, its knowledge of the terrain and a vast tunnel network to turn Gaza's streets into a deadly maze.  At their disposal they have arms ranging from drones rigged with grenades to anti-tank weapons with powerful twin charges.  WHO aid  The World Health Organization welcomed the opening Friday of the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza but said more needed to be done to ensure that essential medical supplies reached hospitals in dire need across the enclave.  Speaking to reporters in Geneva via video link, Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Gaza, described the opening as ""good news"" but said there were hospitals that were difficult to reach in the north of the enclave that still need essential medical supplies.

(COGAT via X/Handout via Reuters)        ""How can we make sure that these [aid] trucks can go everywhere in Gaza, not just to the south but also to the north?"" Peeperkorn asked.  Israel approved the entry of 200 trucks of aid into the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing.  Meanwhile, the U.N. Humanitarian Office said Friday tens of thousands of homeless Gazans who have crammed into Rafah since December 3 are struggling in extremely overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, raising concerns about the spread of disease.  While reiterating U.S. support for Israel and its military response to the deadly Hamas attack against Israel two months ago, U.S. President Joe Biden and other officials have expressed concern about the number of civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.  ""Our support for Israel is not diminished,"" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, ""but we have had concerns, and we have expressed those concerns about the prosecution of this military campaign, even while acknowledging that it's Hamas that started this, and it's Hamas that is continuing it.""  Israel has defended its tactics, saying it is taking unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties, such as ordering people to evacuate areas where it plans to carry out military operations.  Israel's military also has blamed Hamas for intentionally operating in populated areas.  The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency says nearly 1.9 million people, about 85% of Gaza's population, have been forced from their homes, with more than 1.1 million currently registered at the agency's shelters in central and southern Gaza. The agency said the average shelter is nine times over its intended capacity.  After returning from a trip to Gaza on Thursday, World Food Program Deputy Executive Director Carl Skau told reporters at the United Nations in New York that the situation among civilians is ""increasingly desperate and chaotic.""  ""The grim reality is also that nine out of 10 people are not eating enough, or not eating every day, and don't know where their next meal is going to come from,"" he said, adding that no WFP food assistance has reached the north of Gaza since a weeklong cease-fire ended December 1.    Shipping targets  Attacks on commercial vessels have been surging in the Red Sea since the Israel-Hamas war broke out two months ago.  The German government strongly condemned attacks on ships from Houthi-controlled Yemen, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Friday and added that she thanked Saudi Arabia for helping thwart similar attacks by shooting down drones and missiles.                  Huthi military spokesman Brigadier Yahya Saree delivers a statement on the recent attacks against two commercial vessels in the Red Sea during a march in solidarity with the people of Gaza in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Dec. 15, 2023.        ""The Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea must stop immediately,"" Baerbock said during a news conference in Berlin alongside her Lebanese counterpart, Abdallah Bou Habib, when asked about the attack on a vessel owned by German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd.  The German container shipping line is mulling whether to pause sailings through the Red Sea, hours after reporting one of its ships was attacked near Yemen, a spokesperson said Friday.  Also, Danish shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk will pause all container shipments through the Red Sea until further notice and send them instead around Africa, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters on Friday.  The company's vessel Maersk Gibraltar was targeted by a missile while traveling from Salalah, Oman, to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The crew and vessel were reported to be unharmed, the company said Thursday.  VOA White House Correspondent Anita Powell contributed to this report.

Erdogan's visit comes as ties between Ankara and Cairo are back on track after years of tensions and frosty relations. Turkey has long been a backer of the pan-Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group, which has been outlawed as a terrorist organization in Egypt.  The Turkish leader arrived in the Egyptian capital, his first visit to Cairo in over a decade, after visiting the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, where he met with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.  Erdogan met with el-Sissi at Cairo's Ittihadiya palace, according to Egypt's state-run media. Their talks focused on bilateral relations and regional challenges, especially efforts to stop the war in Gaza, el-Sissi later said at a joint news conference.  ""We agreed on the need for an immediate cease-fire (in Gaza) and the need to achieve calm in the West Bank"" to relaunch Israeli-Palestinian peace talks with the ultimate goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state, el-Sissi said.  Egypt and Turkey fell out after the Egyptian military in 2013 ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, amid mass protest against his divisive one year of rule.  Over the past few years, Ankara abandoned its criticism of el-Sissi's government as it tried to repair frayed ties with Egypt and other Arab heavyweights. In November 2022, Erdogan and el-Sissi were photographed shaking hands during the World Cup in Qatar.  The war in Gaza has reached a critical point, with an impeding Israeli offensive on the city of Rafah, along the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt, where some 1.4 million people — over half the territory's population — are crammed into tent camps and overflowing apartments and shelters.  Speaking at the news conference with el-Sissi, Erdogan urged Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avoid a ground offensive in Rafah and accused the Israeli government of committing ""massacres"" in Gaza.  ""Efforts to depopulate Gaza are not acceptable,"" he said.  Egypt is concerned that a ground assault on Rafah would push hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians across the border and into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It has threatened to suspend the country's decades-old peace treaty with Israel.  Egypt, together with Qatar and the United States, a key Israel ally, has been working to try and broker a cease-fire and the return of the remaining 130 hostages held by Hamas, around a fourth of whom are believed to be dead. The negotiators held talks in Cairo on Tuesday but there were no signs of a breakthrough.  The war began with Hamas' assault into Israel on Oct. 7, in which the militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The overall Palestinian death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 28,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, and a quarter of the territory's residents are starving.  ""Before the region is exposed to harsher threats, we need to stop the massacre in Gaza now,"" Erdogan said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/unrwa-chief-agency-essential-to-respond-to-humanitarian-crisis-in-gaza/7486115.html,  UNRWA Chief: Agency Essential to Respond to Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza  ,"      February 13, 2024 3:37 PM      ",  By Lisa Schlein  ,"  Geneva —   The head of the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees has dismissed calls for it to be disbanded and says that UNRWA is the best positioned agency to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  “I have talked with the member states about all these calls for UNRWA to be dismantled, to be terminated and I have warned about the impact. I have said that these calls are short-sighted,” said Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA.  Major donors, including the United States have suspended financial aid to UNRWA after allegations that 12 of the agency’s Palestinian staff participated in Hamas’ October massacre in Israel.  “The impact is not just on the short term. It is not just weakening our collective ability to respond to humanitarian crises at this time … but also during what I would describe as the transition phase; the long days before the end of active military hostilities,” Lazzarini said.                  This photo, taken during a Feb. 8, 2024, media tour organized by the Israeli military, shows Israeli soldiers inside a tunnel that the army claims is a ""Hamas command tunnel"" under a compound of the UNRWA in Gaza City.        He told journalists in Geneva Tuesday that he spent two hours briefing member states about the situation in Rafah, which he described as “deeply, deeply concerning,” noting that Palestinians crammed into this small, overcrowded space were fearful and anxious about Israel mounting a large-scale military operation in the region.  “If this military operation is taking place, the question is where will the civilians go,” he said. “There is absolutely no safe place in Rafah anymore and the fear is that the number of civilians killed and injured might again significantly increase in a conflict where more than 100,000 people already have been either killed, injured or are missing.”                  Palestinians mourn relatives killed in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip at a hospital morgue in Rafah, Feb. 12, 2024. The Israeli military said early Monday that it had rescued the two hostages from captivity in the Gaza Strip.        The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, reports that intense Israeli bombardment from air, land and sea continues across much of the Gaza Strip and that “increased airstrikes in Rafah have heightened concerns of an escalation in the most southerly city in Gaza.”  Before the brutal Hamas terror attack on Israel October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage, Rafah had a population of 200,000. Israel’s ferocious onslaught of Gaza following Hamas’ horrific attack has increased the number of people in Rafah to well over a million.  Lazzarini warns an attack on Rafah by Israel would be “the largest military offensive in the middle of a sea of displaced people. If they are asked to move, the question is where to move.”  “Over a 20-kilometer stretch, you see only plastic makeshift shelters where hundreds of thousands of people are already living,” he said.                   Displaced Palestinians who fled their houses due tor Israeli strikes take shelter in a tent camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 13, 2024.        Were Israel to attack Rafah, he said the Palestinian population will be faced with more suffering, misery, and deprivation of basic survival needs. He said the experience and ability of UNRWA to provide humanitarian assistance to this beleaguered population is not only needed, but irreplaceable.  “We have half a million girls and boys deeply traumatized that we urgently need to bring back to an educational system,” he said.  “This will not be provided by an emerging local administration. There is absolutely no other U.N. agency or INGOs which have been tasked over the last few decades to provide government-like services like education to hundreds of thousands of children.  “And if we want to give a chance to any future transition to succeed, we need also to make sure that the international community has the tools and one of the tools is UNRWA,” he said.  Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, said that Israel remains committed to collaborating with partners to alleviate the suffering and prevent deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  “Israel is at war with the terrorist organization Hamas. … Our fight is with Hamas. It is not with the Palestinian people,” she said.   “Israel is committed to facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah Crossing in Egypt and the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel,” she said, adding that the majority of the aid entering Gaza today is not through UNRWA but through other U.N. agencies.  “As you all know, the United Nations has mechanisms which exist to distribute aid in response to crisis and there are U.N. agencies which are operating and delivering what is required in Gaza, as they do all over the world,” she said.                  Palestinian children wait to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen amid shortages of food supplies in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 13, 2024.        The Israeli ambassador accused UNRWA of harboring terrorists in its ranks. “The international community cannot and should not tolerate or fund a U.N. agency actively shielding and enabling terrorist activities,” she said.  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk warned Monday that a potential full-fledged military incursion in Rafah would likely kill and injure an extremely high number of civilians, mostly children and women, and end the meager humanitarian aid that has been entering Gaza.  “My office has repeatedly warned against actions that violate the laws of war. The prospect of such an operation into Rafah, as circumstances stand, risks further atrocity crimes. … The world must not allow this to happen,” he said.  He called for an immediate cease-fire. He said that “All remaining hostages must be released. And there must be renewed collective resolve to reach a political solution.”  UNRWA Commissioner General Lazzarini echoed those sentiments.  “Maybe after this cataclysm which has hit the region in Gaza, it might be time now to genuinely find a political solution,” he said. “It would be a disaster that, just before it, we get rid of the mandate and an agency like UNRWA.”  "

Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee south from Khan Younis in the last week to escape Israel’s bombardment of Gaza’s second biggest city, adding to the 1.4 million displaced already sheltering in the Rafah region near the Egyptian border, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency said in a statement.

The U.N. agency said most of those fleeing Khan Younis are living in makeshift structures, tents or out in the open.  The 16 countries, led by the United States, suspended $440 million in aid to UNRWA after evidence emerged that 12 of the agency’s 3,000 workers in Gaza assisted Hamas militants in the attack in which some 1,200 people were killed.

White said famine is looming for the Palestinians who remained in north Gaza despite Israeli air attacks and its ground offensive. Gaza health officials say nearly 27,000 people have been killed throughout the territory, most of them women and children, during Israel’s counter-offensive since the October Hamas attack.  “UNRWA received reports that people in the (northern) area are grinding bird feed to make flour,” White said. “We continue to coordinate with the Israeli Army to be able to go to the north, but this has been largely denied. When our convoys are finally permitted to go to the area, people rush to the trucks to get food and often eat it on the spot.”  Israel on Thursday returned 114 Palestinians, including four women, to Gaza from detention in Israel, according to Gazan authorities and Palestinian media. It appeared to be one of the largest such releases during the nearly four-month Israel-Hamas war.                            SEE ALSO:      Israeli Forces Strike Northern and Southern Gaza Amid Push for New Halt in Fighting             The Israeli military said the Palestinians had been detained on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity but were freed when they were cleared of the accusations.  A spokesman for the Gaza crossings authority, Hisham Adwan, charged that many of those released had been subjected to “torture and abuse” during their Israeli imprisonment.  U.S. President Joe Biden, while supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, has for months pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to limit the counter-offensive to curb civilian deaths in Gaza.  On Thursday, Biden targeted “extremist settler violence” against Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled West Bank.  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden signed an executive order that “will allow the United States to issue financial sanctions against those directing or participating in certain actions, including acts or threats of violence against civilians, intimidating civilians to cause them to leave their homes, destroying or seizing property, or engaging in terrorist activity.”  Sullivan said the State Department would be issuing initial sanctions later Thursday.  Israel said Thursday its troops are battling Hamas militants across the Gaza Strip and killing dozens of fighters in central and northern Gaza, while Israeli airstrikes hit Khan Younis in the southern part of the strip.                  Palestinians carry some belongings as they flee Khan Younis to safer areas, Jan. 26, 2024.        The fighting went on as the negotiators for a proposed new cease-fire waited to hear of progress. The proposed agreement calls for a short-term halt in fighting between Israel and Hamas and the release of more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.  The outline for the proposal came out of talks in Paris among U.S., Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials earlier this week. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was expected to travel to Cairo to discuss the plan.  Asked about the details of the proposal during a briefing Wednesday at the White House, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said no pieces were final until the deal itself was finalized.  “I will tell you that, in broad strokes, we are looking at an extended pause is the goal,” Kirby told reporters. “How long? That's all part of the discussions, but longer than what we saw in November, which was about a week.”  More than 100 hostages taken by Hamas during its October 7 terror attack on Israel were released during the November cease-fire in exchange for 240 Palestinians jailed by Israel. Hamas is believed to still be holding another 100 or so hostages.  Kirby said it is possible to get more hostages out of Gaza if there is a longer cease-fire, and that a longer pause would also facilitate increasing the flow of humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza.  “We want to see this deal in place,” Kirby said. “We want to see it in place as soon as possible.”  Hamas has called for a permanent cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.  Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza and has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, Britain, the European Union and others.

https://www.voanews.com/a/china-circumspect-after-international-court-ruling-on-israel/7465514.html,  China Circumspect After International Court Ruling on Israel  ,"      January 31, 2024 4:49 PM      ",  By Kate Bartlett  ,"  Johannesburg, South Africa —   In a carefully worded response this week, China voiced its support of the U.N.’s International Court of Justice, or ICJ, ruling that orders Israel to desist from the killing of Palestinians in Gaza. Experts tell VOA that privately China has reservations about the use of such courts to deal with allegations of genocide, which could have awkward implications for Beijing.  “We hope that the ICJ’s provisional measures can be effectively implemented,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin when asked about the issue at a regular press conference on Monday. While the EU and U.S. reacted almost immediately to Friday’s ruling in The Hague, Wang’s comments were the first from a previously taciturn Beijing and came in response to a question from state broadcaster CCTV.  “We condemn all acts against civilians and oppose all moves that violate international law. China urges parties to the conflict to realize a comprehensive cease-fire at once, abide by the international humanitarian law,” he said.  South Africa’s case  It was the South African government — a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause — that asked the ICJ to investigate whether Israel was committing genocide in the war in Gaza, which began in response to an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.  While a final ruling on whether genocide has indeed been committed is years down the road, the court announced provisional measures in the case last week. A majority of the judges — including a Chinese judge — ruled that South Africa had a plausible case and that Israel must now take every measure to avoid causing deaths in Gaza.                         SEE ALSO:      Ramaphosa Says South Africa 'Vindicated' in Israel Genocide Case            Israel has slammed allegations of genocide, and President Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the court’s order by vowing to continue the war. Israel’s key ally, the United States, played down the ruling and noted it did not call for a cease-fire. But experts said the damning nature of the ruling was embarrassing for both democracies, which are proponents of international law.  South Africa — which has a close relationship with China — hailed the ruling as a win for the so-called Global South, of which Beijing sees itself as a leader.  Israel and the U.S. are both members of the ICJ, whose rules are binding. However, there is no enforcement mechanism, so sometimes — as in the case of the court’s 2022 ruling that Russia must exit Ukraine — its orders are ignored.  Usually, China is quick to point out anything it sees as U.S. hypocrisy, but on this issue Beijing has remained tight-lipped. Some experts think that is because Beijing is afraid of the precedent it could set.  China wary  “I think China is using the ICJ decision to push for de-escalation. But it made no mentioning of genocide and called the decision a ‘temporary measure,’” Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, told VOA.  “‘Genocide’ is a sensitive word for China, and I doubt China wants to set the precedent that it can be declared and imposed on a sovereign country,” she said.  Paul Nantulya, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, echoed this view.  “They are privately very worried about precedent,” he wrote to VOA. “It is very possible for a state that is not directly affected by the goings on in Xinjiang to bring a case at the ICJ.”  Nantulya was referring to China’s policies regarding the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province. The United Nations and rights groups have accused Beijing of persecuting the minority group, which, evidence has shown, is subjected to torture, sexual violence and mass arbitrary detention in camps.  In 2022, former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet reported China’s counterterrorism policies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.”                         SEE ALSO:      UN Rights Chief: China’s Treatment of Uyghurs May Constitute Crimes Against Humanity             Lawyers representing Uyghurs in exile filed a case with another global judicial body, the International Criminal Court, also in The Hague, Netherlands, in 2020. They accused senior Chinese leaders of genocide, but the ICC said it could not hear the case because the alleged crimes happened in China, which — like the U.S. — is not a party to the court.  The lawyers have argued the ICC should still take up the case given evidence of Beijing’s efforts to round up Uyghurs in neighboring countries that are members of the court.                         SEE ALSO:      ICC Urged to Investigate China's Treatment of Uyghurs            However, unlike with the ICC, even a state that is not party to a conflict can bring charges against another state at the ICJ if they are both members of the court — as are South Africa and Israel.  South Africa was the second country to use the court this way, after West African state Gambia filed a genocide case against Myanmar over its persecution of the Rohingya Muslims.  In 2022, the ICJ set a precedent by ruling it would hear Gambia’s case on the basis that all parties to the Genocide Convention have an interest in ensuring the prevention of genocide anywhere in the world.  “I don't think this sits easily with the Chinese side,” Nantulya said, given that China is an ICJ member.  Therefore, he said, Beijing is unlikely to chide Israel, and by association the U.S., over any noncompliance. “Softly, softly will be their approach.”  Cobus van Staden, an analyst with the South African Institute for International Affairs, told VOA he thinks China shares South Africa’s position overall on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  “Where I think they become more cautious is around the international institution aspect … and obviously they are wary of those tools kind of being turned against them,” he said.  Jonathan Hafetz, professor of law at Seton Hall Law School in New Jersey, likewise noted China’s “reticence in accepting the jurisdiction of international tribunals.” However, he said it was a reticence “shared by other major global powers, including the United States.”  "

Israel described the allegations leveled by South Africa as hypocritical and said one of the biggest cases ever to come before an international court reflected a world turned upside down. Israeli leaders defend their air and ground offensive in Gaza as a legitimate response to Hamas' October 7 attack, when militants stormed through Israeli communities, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.  Israeli legal advisor Tal Becker told a packed auditorium at the ornate Palace of Peace in The Hague that the country is fighting a ""war it did not start and did not want.""  ""In these circumstances, there can hardly be a charge more false and more malevolent than the allegation against Israel of genocide,"" he added, noting that the horrible suffering of civilians in war was not enough to level that charge.  On Friday afternoon, Germany said it wants to intervene in the proceedings on Israel's behalf, saying there was ""no basis whatsoever"" for an accusation of genocide against Israel.  ""Hamas terrorists brutally attacked, tortured, killed and kidnapped innocent people in Israel,"" German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement. ""Since then, Israel has been defending itself against the inhumane attack by Hamas.""  Under the court's rules, if Germany files a declaration of intervention in the case, it will be able to make legal arguments on behalf of Israel.                  Judges and parties sit during a hearing at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 12, 2024.        Germany would be allowed to intervene at the merits phase of the case to address how the genocide convention, drawn up in 1948 following World War II, should be interpreted, according to international lawyer Balkees Jarrah, associate director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch.  ""That would come after the court issues its decision on South Africa's request for urgent measures to protect the Palestinian people in Gaza,"" Jarrah told The Associated Press from The Hague, where she attended the ICJ hearings.  Germany's support for Israel carries some symbolic significance given its Nazi history.  Hebestreit said Germany ""sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide."" He added: ""We firmly oppose political instrumentalization.""  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the announcement, saying the gesture ""touches all of Israel's citizens.""  South African lawyers asked the court Thursday to order an immediate halt to Israeli military operations in the besieged coastal territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians. A decision on that request will probably take weeks, and the full case is likely to last years — and it's unclear if Israel would follow any court orders.  On Friday, Israel focused on the brutality of the October 7 attacks, presenting chilling video and audio to a hushed audience.  ""They tortured children in front of parents and parents in front of children, burned people, including infants alive, and systematically raped and mutilated scores of women, men and children,"" Becker said.  South Africa's request for an immediate halt to the Gaza fighting, he said, amounts to an attempt to prevent Israel from defending itself against that assault.  Even when acting in self-defense, countries are required by international law to follow the rules of war, and judges must decide if Israel has.  As two days of hearings ended Friday, ICJ President Joan E. Donoghue said the court would rule on the request for urgent measures ""as soon as possible.""  Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, Israeli leaders took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously they regard the case and likely their fear that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country's international standing.  Still, Becker dismissed the accusations as crude and attention-seeking.  ""We live at a time when words are cheap in an age of social media and identity politics. The temptation to reach for the most outrageous term to vilify and demonize has become, for many, irresistible,"" he said.                  Protesters carry flags and banners outside the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 12, 2024.        In a statement from New York, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called the case a ""new moral low"" and said that by taking it on, ""the U.N. and its institutions have become weapons in service of terrorist organizations.""  Becker said the charges Israel is facing should be leveled at Hamas, which seeks Israel's destruction and which the U.S. and Western allies consider a terrorist group.  ""If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel,"" Becker said.  More than 23,000 people in Gaza have been killed during Israel's military campaign, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory. That toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Nearly 85% of Gaza's people have been driven their homes, a quarter of the enclave's residents face starvation, and much of northern Gaza has been reduced to rubble.  South Africa says this amounts to genocide and is part of decades of Israeli oppression of Palestinians.  ""The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,"" said lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, adding that several leading politicians had made dehumanizing comments about people in Gaza.  The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry welcomed the case, saying in a written statement that South Africa ""delivered unequivocal evidence that Israel is deliberately and systematically violating its obligations under the Genocide Convention.""  Israel says that it takes measures to protect civilians, such as issuing evacuation orders ahead of strikes. It blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the group uses residential areas to stage attacks and for other military purposes.  The case also strikes at the heart of both Israel's and South Africa's national identities.  Israel was founded as a Jewish state in the wake of the Nazis' slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II. South Africa's governing party, meanwhile, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to ""homelands.""  The world court, which rules on disputes between nations, has never judged a country to be responsible for genocide. The closest it came was in 2007, when it ruled that Serbia ""violated the obligation to prevent genocide"" in the July 1995 massacre by Bosnian Serb forces of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica.

""The level of desperation of people is palpable and breathable. It is a situation of desperation that you can feel it, that you can really touch it with your hands,"" said Andrea De Domenico, head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  Speaking from Jerusalem to journalists in Geneva on Friday, De Domenico said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are crammed into ever smaller spaces and forced to set up makeshift shelters in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, with no toilets or basic amenities.                  Palestinian farmers inspect an agricultural greenhouse after it was hit in an Israeli airstrike, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 11, 2024.        ""There is no public service. There is a lack of shelter, a lack of water, a lack of food, and a lack of health. … This high pressure is turning more and more into increasing tension vis-à-vis the U.N. and vis-à-vis the humanitarian community who are unable to address their basic needs.  ""[The desperate Palestinians in Gaza] are not aggressive so far, but this tension will increase if we do not scale up our operations,"" he said, noting that when supply trucks cross the border into Gaza, Palestinians go to the trucks, thank the U.N. for coming and then ""take whatever they can for them and their families to survive.""  The OCHA representative said his team has told him that ""the faces of the people who are coming to the trucks … are clearly the faces of people who are starving.""  This Sunday will mark 100 days since Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched their attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people, mostly Israeli, were killed and around 240 hostages taken, among them children.  The brutal assault unleashed a ferocious response by Israel's military, reportedly resulting in the deaths of more than 23,000 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, and the massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals, schools and places of worship.  ""As U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has repeatedly urged, there must be an immediate cease-fire on human rights and humanitarian grounds,"" said Turk's spokeswoman, Liz Throssell.  It is more urgent than ever that there be ""a cease-fire to end the appalling suffering and loss of life, and to allow the prompt and effective delivery of humanitarian aid to a population facing shocking levels of hunger and disease,"" she said, adding that Israeli Defence Forces ""must take immediate measures to protect civilians fully in line with Israel's obligation under international law.""                  Palestinians wounded in an Israeli strike are treated in a hospital in Kahan Younis, Gaza Strip, Jan. 12, 2024.        The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) echoed this plea for an immediate and long-lasting cease-fire, stressing that this ""is the only way to end the killing and injuring of children and their families and enable the urgent delivery of desperately needed aid.""  Speaking from Jerusalem, Lucia Elmi, UNICEF's special representative in the Palestinian territories, warned that conditions in the Gaza strip — especially for children — continue to deteriorate rapidly.  ""Children in Gaza are running out of time, while most of the lifesaving humanitarian aid they desperately need remains stranded between insufficient access corridors and protracted layers of inspections,"" she said.  ""Thousands of children have already died and thousands more will quickly follow"" if the problems of conflict, disease and malnutrition are not quickly addressed, she added.  By way of illustration, she noted that in the past two weeks, the number of diarrhea cases among children under five has almost doubled from 40,000 to 70,000.  The conflict, along with the increased burden of disease and the increasing severity of malnutrition, is putting at risk over 135,000 children of severe acute malnutrition.  ""The combination of these three problems plus the lack of water and sanitation in terms of malnutrition is one of the key concerns at the moment,"" she said.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/who-life-saving-aid-not-reaching-millions-of-people-caught-in-health-emergencies/7435701.html,  WHO: Lifesaving Aid Not Reaching Millions of People Caught in Health Emergencies  ,"      January 11, 2024 10:28 AM      ",  By Lisa Schlein  ,"  Geneva —   The World Health Organization is warning that millions of people caught in conflict-driven health emergencies risk dying from traumatic wounds and infectious diseases because life-saving humanitarian aid is not reaching those in need.  In one of his most forceful statements to date, the WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accused the Israeli government of blocking essential aid to Gaza.  In a briefing to journalists Wednesday, Tedros said a humanitarian mission to northern Gaza planned for that day, the sixth since December 26, had to be canceled because “our requests were rejected and assurances of safe passage were not provided.”  “Delivering humanitarian aid in Gaza continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges. Intense bombardment, restrictions on movement, fuel shortages, and interrupted communications make it impossible for WHO and our partners to reach those in need,” he said. “We call on Israel to approve requests by WHO and other partners to deliver humanitarian aid. … Health care must always be protected and respected; it cannot be attacked, and it cannot be militarized.”  WHO officials say Gaza is buckling under what they call a perfect storm for the proliferation of disease. As of January 1, it has documented nearly 200,000 respiratory infections and tens of thousands of cases of scabies, lice, skin rashes, and jaundice.  The agency says 2,140 cases of diarrhea among children under five in Gaza were reported in 2021-2022; by November 2023, that number had increased 20-fold to 42,655 cases.  “This is an underestimation,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory, speaking in Jerusalem. “We lack access to health facilities. …So, the situation is likely to be worse.  “If the situation is not improved, we can expect more outbreaks and deaths,” he warned.                  Palestinians line up with their children to receive vaccine shots for them, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 2, 2024. Vaccines were unavailable for weeks due to the war and are still scarce in many parts of Gaza.        Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health says at least 23,357 Palestinians have been killed and 59,410 injured since Hamas terrorists invaded Israel October 7, killing 1,200 people, and taking some 240 hostages.  The WHO says it is impossible to access the population in Gaza without an effective deconfliction system in place because of the massive destruction of Gaza’s public health infrastructure and continued intense hostilities.  “We have heard various comments that the U.N. isn’t doing enough,” said Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program.  “If you continue to destroy infrastructure, if you continue to destroy services at this rate, and then you blame the people who come in and support and provide life-saving assistance—who is to blame here?” he said. “We are on the ground, and we are serving. We can do much more. We must be given the means to do much more, but right now that is not possible.”  In a virtual briefing Friday, Col. Elad Goren, head of the civil department of COGAT, the Israeli agency that facilitates aid in Gaza, said the “narrative of blockade — that is completely false.”  He said that U.N. and other humanitarian agencies have told him that there was a “sufficient amount of food in Gaza and we continue to push the humanitarian agencies to collect more trucks at the borders and to distribute them.”  He added that “Israel has not and will not stand in the way of providing humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza that are not a part of terror. They are not our enemy.”    While Gaza continues to dominate headlines globally, WHO chief Tedros warned that millions of people in other countries in conflict, notably Sudan and Ethiopia, are threatened by increasing violence, mass displacement, spread of disease, famine, and death, and must not be forgotten.  In the past month, he said conflict has displaced half-a-million people from Al-Gezira state, which used to be a haven from the conflict in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.                  Refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan queue with their jerrycans to collect drinking water at a distribution point at the Ourang refugee camp in Adre, Chad, Dec. 7, 2023.        “Due to security concerns, WHO has temporarily halted its operations in Al-Gezira,” he said. “The state is also considered the breadbasket of Sudan, and fighting there has disrupted the annual harvest, and increased the risk of food insecurity in conflict-affected areas.”  Tedros also said conditions have deteriorated especially for Sudanese children since war erupted in mid-April, noting an estimated 3.5 million children under the age of 5 — one in seven — are acutely malnourished, and “more than 100,000 are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, requiring hospitalization.”  Tedros expressed grave concern about the worsening health crisis in parts of Ethiopia, saying the northwestern region of Amhara has been badly affected by conflict since April and restrictions on movement were hampering efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance.  “Fighting is affecting access to health facilities, either through damage or destruction, roadblocks, and other obstacles,” he said. “Health authorities are unable to deliver training and supplies and are unable to transport samples for laboratory confirmation in many areas.  “Disease outbreaks are spreading in northern Ethiopia, as the result of conflict, drought, economic shocks, and malnutrition, especially in the Tigray and Amhara regions,” where many people reportedly were suffering from near-famine conditions, he said, adding that “the most pressing need is for access to the affected areas, so we can assess the need and respond accordingly.”  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/health-catastrophe-unfolding-in-gaza-as-humanitarian-space-shrinks-/7432854.html,  Health Catastrophe Unfolding in Gaza as Humanitarian Space Shrinks  ,"      January 09, 2024 1:04 PM      ",  By Lisa Schlein  ,"  Geneva —   World Health Organization officials warn a humanitarian and health catastrophe is unfolding in the Gaza Strip as the humanitarian space for providing life-saving treatment and aid is shrinking.  “At the same time that we are seeing this humanitarian catastrophe unfold before our eyes, we are seeing the health system collapse,” said Sean Casey, WHO Emergency Medical Teams Coordinator.  “Hospitals are closing, patients are lacking access to health facilities, health workers are being forced to flee for their safety,” he said, adding that people could be treated and lives could be saved, “if they had access to care.”  Casey, who has been in Gaza for the past five weeks, described seeing “a dramatic interruption in health services and a dramatic loss of access to health care workers.  “There are hundreds and thousands of patients awaiting surgery and it continues to be a shrinking of humanitarian space, and a shrinking of health services across the Gaza Strip,” he said.  Speaking to journalists from Rafah Tuesday about a recent visit to Al-Aqsa Hospital, he described conditions there as shocking, with only a skeleton crew available to care for large numbers of sick and war-wounded.  “When I visited and walked through the emergency department, I saw once again as I have seen in hospitals across Gaza over the last five weeks, patients being cared for on the floor.  “When I was there on Sunday, it was mostly children with gunshot wounds, with shrapnel injuries. Children who were playing in the street when the building next to them exploded. They were waiting, in some cases an hour or more just to be seen, with serious injuries bleeding on the floor and with just a handful of doctors and nurses there to care for them.”                  A Palestinian child wounded during the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip is brought to the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 6, 2024.        Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health says at least 23,084 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, 70% of whom are women and children, since Hamas terrorists brutally invaded Israel October 7, killing more than 1,200 people and abducting some 240 hostages. During the same period, 58,926 Palestinians reportedly have been injured.  “We are talking about 3.5% of the population very much directly affected,” said Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory.  Speaking from Jerusalem, he said, “I want to say something also about the injured. We talk about multiple trauma cases, patients with multiple traumas, spinal trauma, terrible injuries, severe burns, amputees.  “I have never seen so many amputees in my life, including among children, which, if you think about it, not only the patients themselves, but the families and community means that this will have a long-term impact for everything.”  Peeperkorn also described the difficulty of getting humanitarian supplies into Gaza, and the inability of getting humanitarian aid and workers within Gaza to reach people in need.  “As long as there is no cease-fire, humanitarian corridors are required within Gaza to make sure that aid gets through,” he said. “Hostilities and evacuation orders in neighborhoods of the middle area and Khan Younis, Gaza are affecting access to hospitals for patients and ambulances and making it incredibly complex for WHO to reach those hospitals to provide supplies and fuel.”  The European Gaza Hospital, Nasser Medical Complex and Al-Aqsa Hosptial, he said, are near evacuation zones.  “These three hospitals are a lifeline in the south, where about two million people are present,” said Peeperkorn. “What we see is that the constricted flow of supplies and access, and the evacuation of medical staff from many hospitals due to fears for safety, is a recipe for disaster and makes more hospitals non-functional, as witnessed in the north.”  The WHO, which has documented 590 attacks on health care facilities in the occupied Palestinian territory since October 7, has been forced to cancel six planned missions to northern parts of the Gaza Strip since December 26.  The organization has also reported that 304 attacks in the Gaza Strip have resulted in 606 fatalities and 774 injuries. The attacks have affected 94 health care facilities, including damage to 26 of 36 hospitals in Gaza.  According to UNRWA, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, some 1.9 million people, or nearly 85% of the total population of Gaza, is internally displaced.  “Many have been displaced multiple times,” said the WHO’s Sean Casey. “Here in Rafah where I am, people are sleeping under tarpaulins, under makeshift tents, under incredibly crowded conditions.  “These people lack access to primary health care. There is no secondary or tertiary hospital close by that is accessible,” he added. “So, people are moving from one bad situation to another. There is no hospital in Gaza where you can go and expect to get care with certainty.”  Casey also said hospitals are bursting at the seams with patients suffering from hunger, numerous infectious and chronic diseases as well as horrific war injuries, many requiring surgery, including amputations.  Casey said that when patients do manage to reach a hospital there are so few medical professionals available that “their initial focus is damage control, which is keeping people alive.”  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-pm-modi-opens-hindu-temple-in-uae-ahead-of-elections/7487172.html,  Indian PM Modi Opens Hindu Temple in UAE Ahead of Elections  ,"      February 14, 2024 10:13 AM      ",  By Associated Press  ,"  ABU MUREIKHA, United Arab Emirates —   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Middle East's first traditional, stone-built Hindu temple on Wednesday, internationalizing his reelection campaign and his effort to push secular India into a Hindu state.   The trip to the BAPS Hindu Mandir just north of the city of Abu Dhabi capped Modi's whistlestop tour of the United Arab Emirates during which the Indian leader embraced the UAE's president, describing him as a brother, and spoke before global leaders at a Dubai summit.   Modi is widely expected to win a third term as prime minister in the upcoming elections in India, the world's largest democracy. But Modi's policies and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party have raised concerns over India's future, particularly for members of its Muslim minority as they have come under attack in recent years by Hindu nationalist groups.   That has made warming Indian relations with the Muslim-led Gulf Arab states crucial not only for India's energy security and for millions of its expatriate workers in the region, but also its international standing.   Modi visited the temple in Abu Mureikha, built by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, or BAPS, a worldwide religious and civic organization within the Swaminarayan sect. Modi has close ties to the organization.   Modi walked past the temple's seven spires, a nod to the autocratic UAE's seven sheikhdoms. He looked inside the temple, where earlier Wednesday a priest had consecrated the statues of deities, each worshipped by different Hindu denominations across India.   The prime minister waved at a crowd of thousands gathered for the event, described as a Festival of Harmony, some spilling out into overflow seating outside. Children greeted Modi, and others cheered his movements through the temple with priests.                   India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi waves during a tour of the BAPS Hindu Mandir, the largest Hindu temple in the Middle East, at its inauguration ceremony on Feb. 14, 2024, in Abu Dhabi.        The temple effort extends back home for Modi. In January, he opened a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya.   That temple is dedicated to Hinduism's Lord Ram and had been wanted by Hindus who describe it as restoring a religion suppressed by centuries of Mughal and British colonial rule. But the 1992 demolition of the mosque at the site trigged riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.  Earlier Wednesday, Modi spoke before the World Governments Summit in Dubai, hosted by the city-state's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Much of the speech could be seen as a stump speech on the global stage.  ""Over the years, the trust of the people of the country on the government of India has become stronger,"" Modi said. ""People have full faith in both the intentions and commitments of our government.  ""It is as a friend to the world that India is moving forward,"" he said.  Modi's personal touch on the trip, including embracing Emirati President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, seems aimed at further cementing ties with the UAE, an oil-rich country that supplies India's energy needs while also serving as a home for some 3.5 million Indians.  The relationship also underscores the Emirates' realpolitik foreign policy. Modi received the Emirates' top civilian honor in 2019 even as he stripped statehood from the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.  "

French President Emmanuel Macron’s office announced the development Thursday but did not provide details about the deal.  During Zelenskyy’s visit, Macron will “reaffirm France’s determination to continue to provide unwavering support to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, over the long term and with all its partners,” the French presidency said.  Zelenskyy’s office said he will also travel Friday to Germany for talks with Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  The meetings come amid a flurry of international gatherings this week, including the Munich Security Conference Saturday that Zelenskyy is due to attend.  NATO defense chiefs met Thursday in Brussels to discuss how to sustain their support for Ukraine in its battle against a full-scale Russian invasion that began nearly two years ago.  NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that allies need to increase their defense production “to ensure that Ukraine gets the weapons, the supplies, the ammunition it needs.”  Stoltenberg said he also expects the U.S. Congress to agree on a new support package for Ukraine after funding ran out in December.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod regional governor, said another 18 people were hurt in the Ukrainian attack.   Russia’s defense ministry reported destroying 14 rockets in the Belgorod area, which is located near the border with Ukraine and has been the site of repeated Ukrainian attacks.                   Aftermath of a Russian missile attack in Lviv        Ukrainian officials said the Russian missiles fired Thursday injured at least six people and damaged multiple buildings.   Maksym Kozytskyi, the regional governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, said three people were hurt there as the missiles damaged an infrastructure building and several homes.   Officials in the city of Zaporizhzhia reported four people wounded, with damage to a school and a shop from the Russian attack.   Russian missiles also targeted the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where officials said air defenses were able to shoot down all of the missiles and that there were no reported injuries.   The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched a total of 26 missiles, with Ukrainian air defenses destroying half of them.   Stoltenberg said Thursday a Ukrainian attack that destroyed a Russian navy large landing ship in the Black Sea showed the impact of support for Ukraine’s military.

When asked about the attack Wednesday, the Kremlin would not comment.   Ukrainian forces have destroyed several ships in Russia’s Black Sea fleet since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.   Ukraine’s military intelligence shared a video on Telegram purportedly showing several naval drones approaching a large vessel, followed by a large explosion.   “Once again, the Ukraine shows its prowess in integrating unmanned systems tactically to have a strategic effect,” retired Rear Adm. Joseph A. DiGuardo told VOA’s Ukrainian Service. “The implications of the success of this type of maritime strike on technically advanced navies around the world is immense and will require many to rethink vessel protection and threat mitigation.”   Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea “are a major deal,” a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters Wednesday.   “The fact that the Russian navy cannot operate in the Black Sea at will, compared to how it could operate at the beginning of this war is a fundamental shift in the strategic position in the Black Sea region.”   Some information for this report came from the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters  "

In recent weeks, there has been growing momentum behind efforts to permanently seize the frozen funds, estimated to total approximately $300 billion, and use them to help Ukraine offset the vast cost of rebuilding its towns and infrastructure destroyed by Russia’s invasion.  In Washington, the Biden administration has signaled its support for a legislative effort to smooth a path toward seizure of the approximately $50 billion-$60 billion in Russian funds held by U.S. financial institutions.  Europe, where most of the Russian funds currently reside, appears to be taking a more cautious path that could lead to the interest earned by frozen Russian funds being directed to Ukraine’s use, while leaving the underlying funds untouched.  The G7 group of large economies has backed a suggestion that the frozen Russian assets be treated as collateral for zero-interest loans that could be used to fund Ukrainian reconstruction.  Sending a message  Supporters of confiscating Russian funds say that doing so is necessary to underscore the community of nations’ disapproval of Russia’s actions.  “I think it sends a signal that egregious aggression of this form will not be tolerated,” Simon Johnson, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told VOA.  Johnson said it is unprecedented for a country that starts a war of aggression like the one Russia is waging in Ukraine to have such large foreign reserves.  “They built up these reserves, I think, thinking they would give them a buffer that would allow them to behave in a more reckless manner,” Johnson said. “And I think the message should be sent to them and others that actually, if you want to engage with the world economy and with the U.S. and with others, that's not how it's going to work. You're not going to be able to run these current account surpluses, and then use that to finance your wars.”  Russian retaliation  Russian officials have threatened to retaliate for any seizure of the country’s assets with similar seizures of Western assets under Russian jurisdiction, though it is unclear whether a comparable amount of foreign assets is held in Russian banks.  “Of course, the Russian Federation will challenge such decisions. We will protect our interests and our assets illegally seized,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Reuters earlier this month. “Encroachment on someone else's property undermines all the foundations of the economic system, including the economic system of those who will implement these decisions.”  He added, “We are convinced that decision-makers also understand the inevitability of these consequences. We are watching very closely.”  International law  But supporters of the move say the options being considered to seize Russian assets are all compatible with existing international law.  “The general view by many lawyers from multiple countries is that if this decision is made by international bodies, that it is an ‘authorized taking,’ whether it be the pledge against loans or just expropriating the assets themselves,” Mark Kennedy, director of the Wilson Center’s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, told VOA.  “I think it is going to happen in some way, shape or form, though whether it's near term or not is yet to be seen,” he said. “There’s a feeling that this is appropriate justice, vis-a-vis Russia.”  ‘REPO’ Act  There is currently some disagreement in the U.S. about whether the government has the legal authority to go beyond simply freezing Russian funds and actually transfer the ownership of them to a third party.  Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe and several colleagues last year produced a lengthy report asserting that current U.S. law offers the government sufficient authority to transfer Russian assets held in the U.S. to Ukraine.  However, not everyone agrees.  “The executive branch and Treasury … have the power to freeze, and they have the power to transfer possession of assets so that they are safe from grab-backs by their owners,” Paul B. Stephan, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, told VOA. “But the word ‘transfer’ in the statute clearly applies only to possession and not ownership.”  In Washington, both the House and the Senate are considering a piece of legislation — the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act — that would explicitly authorize the president to confiscate Russian assets held in financial institutions under U.S. jurisdiction.  The funds would be deposited in an account, the Ukraine Support Fund, which would be created by the legislation.  Stephan, who said he personally supports the idea of using Russian assets to aid Ukraine, said the REPO Act would remove any legal barrier to seizing ownership of Russia funds. However, he described other aspects of it, such as language that bars U.S. courts from hearing claims against such asset seizures, as “problematic.”  EU and G7  In Europe this week, the European Union passed legislation requiring financial institutions that hold more than $1.2 million in Russian central bank assets to place revenue earned by those assets in separate accounts.  The idea is that future legislation will be considered to create a mechanism by which the European Commission can transfer those profits to the EU budget, and then on to Ukrainian control.  Separately, the G7 countries have been considering a somewhat different plan. Because the international community generally recognizes that Russia will be liable to pay Ukraine reparations at the end of the conflict, the world’s largest economies are considering measures that would treat frozen Russian funds as collateral against loans taken out to assist Ukraine in rebuilding.  The plan would involve the creation of a special purpose vehicle to issue so-called “zero-coupon” bonds, which require no interest payments, backed by the frozen funds.  "

https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-dominance-in-iowa-sets-tone-for-republican-primary-/7442836.html,  Trump's Dominance in Iowa Sets Tone for Republican Primary  ,"      January 16, 2024 6:01 PM      ",  By Rob Garver  ,"  Donald Trump on Monday night cruised to victory in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses.  Just 110,298, or less than 15%, of the state's 752,000 registered Republican voters took part in Monday's caucus.  Trump won with 56,260 votes, or 51%, setting a record for the largest margin of victory in a contested caucus in the state's history.  The former president's closest competitors were, in fact, not very close at all. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis earned 23,420 votes (21.2%), while former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley garnered 21,085 votes (19.1%). Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy received 8,449 votes (7.7%) and used his concession speech to announce his exit from the race and his endorsement of Trump. None of the other candidates in the race received even 1% of the vote.  The win gives Trump momentum headed into next week's primary election in New Hampshire, where Haley has been gathering strength in hopes of an upset victory that might inject new energy into her campaign.  Trump's electorate  The last time Trump ran in a competitive caucus in Iowa, when he was seeking the nomination in 2016, he lost a close race to Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In that contest, Trump earned 24.3% of the vote, or less than half of the share he claimed on Monday.  A poll of voters entering Iowa caucus sites Monday evening demonstrated the degree to which Trump has consolidated the support of a large share of the Republican electorate.  Trump had the backing of 49% of male voters heading into caucus sites, and 53% of female voters. He held 47% pluralities among urban and suburban voters, and a 57% majority of rural votes.  In an electorate that skewed older than the nation as a whole, Trump took a plurality of 42% of voters between 30 and 44 years of age, and won 54% of voters between 45 and 64, and 58% of voters 65 and older. He was weakest among voters 17 to 29, winning only 22% of their votes, compared to DeSantis' 30% and Haley's 25%.  Dedicated conservatives  Among the more remarkable shifts was Trump's performance among voters who identify themselves as evangelical or ""born-again"" Christians. In 2016, Cruz beat Trump soundly in the contest for that demographic. Yet on Monday, the former president claimed 53% of the evangelical vote, nearly twice DeSantis' 27%.  The voters who show up for caucus-style votes are typically more committed than the general electorate, as the process can take several hours to complete. Polls showed that 52% of caucus-goers on Monday identified as being ""very conservative,"" with an additional 37% calling themselves ""somewhat conservative."" Only 9% considered themselves ""moderate.""  Two out of three caucus-goers told pollsters they believe Trump's false claim that President Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election. With Trump currently facing 91 felony counts in four different jurisdictions, 65% said they believe the former president would be fit for office even if he is convicted of a crime.  DeSantis in trouble  Monday's results were a blow to DeSantis, who had staked much on his performance in Iowa. The Florida governor has been a regular presence in the state for months and plowed a large share of his once-formidable campaign war chest into investments in a get-out-the-vote operation there.                  Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks to supporters during a caucus night party, Jan. 15, 2024, in West Des Moines, Iowa.        DeSantis received the endorsements of Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, and influential conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats. But high-profile backers and a strong campaign organization were simply no match for Trump's broad base of support in the state.  In a sign of his strategy for moving forward, the DeSantis campaign said he would be in South Carolina on Tuesday for a campaign event. He will still campaign in New Hampshire, which votes on January 23, but the move appeared to be an attempt to lower expectations for his performance there.  While Haley is competitive with Trump in New Hampshire, polls indicate DeSantis' support there is barely in the double digits.  Rolling the dice on South Carolina  Robert Oldendick, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina, said that DeSantis' decision to highlight his effort in that state appeared to be a gamble that he could retain some viability in the race by challenging Haley in her home state when it votes in late February.  ""If he would have had a very strong second place finish [in Iowa], he might have tried to compete in New Hampshire,"" Oldendick told VOA. ""But … the Republican primary electorate in New Hampshire is not really very consistent with the type of issues that he is presenting. They're more independent voters and are much more likely to support Haley. So, rather than competing there and getting trounced, maybe he has a better chance competing with Haley in her home state.""  But even on Haley's home turf, Oldendick said, the two will still likely be battling for second place.  ""South Carolina essentially looks much like Iowa in the sense that Trump has pretty much unwavering support, so that he's going to come out first. And then, it's just a matter of what second and third look like,"" he said.  Haley in New Hampshire  Haley's third-place finish in Iowa, despite some polls suggesting she had pulled ahead of DeSantis, may have seemed like a setback to her supporters. But there was little time to dwell on the result, with voting in New Hampshire a week away.                  Republican presidential candidate and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at a caucus night party in West Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 15, 2024.        Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire who has studied the state's primaries, said the candidate has a clear task in front of her.  ""Nikki Haley is going to spend the next week barnstorming the state and trying to piece together a coalition of unlikely allies — moderate Republicans, anti-Trump independents, a few Democrats who are bored with nothing to do,"" Scala told VOA.  With Trump ahead of her by about 10% in most polls, she will need to assemble ""some kind of coalition that crosses party lines, that includes large numbers of independents,"" he said.  Scala described the possibility of a Haley upset victory in New Hampshire as ""plausible,"" but said that her chances, ""surely would have been fortified by a strong second-place finish instead of a third-place finish [in Iowa].""    'Writing on the wall'    Experts told VOA that barring a major upheaval in the race, Trump appears to be on track to secure the Republican nomination.  ""We've been seeing the writing on the wall for a while now that Trump just has this huge amount of support within the party,"" Seth Masket, a professor of political science and director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, told VOA.  ""Party voters overwhelmingly prefer him, and he is running more or less like an incumbent. The real question was whether the polling was overestimating or underestimating his support. It turns out, it basically had it right,"" he said.  Masket added that there is always a possibility that something could happen to derail Trump's progress — an illness, or a criminal conviction, for example — but that it looks less likely every day.  ""Trump has the support he has,"" Masket said. ""He's already gotten a little above 50% in this first state, and there's probably not that many states where he's going to do worse. So, this could go on for a while still. But it's hard to see where one of these other candidates really makes up a lot of ground.""  "

That is the truth. And that is what resonates in the hearts of the American people. We are on their side. It's the side of common sense. It's the side of security, side of stability.”  But Democrats said the majority of the U.S. House of Representatives, including some moderate Republicans, want to debate and vote on the Senate legislation.  “All we're asking for is a vote,” House Democratic Chair Pete Aguilar told reporters Wednesday. “Over 300 members would vote for a package like that, but the question isn't for House Democrats. The question is for Speaker Johnson. What is he afraid of? To put national security first? To help our country push back against Putin and make sure that our country is protected? What is his concern?”  In a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, ""Traditional Republicans must now put America first, and stand up to Pro-Putin extremists in the House who apparently want Russia to win. The American people deserve an up or down vote, and we will use every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line.""  House Democrats could force a vote through a procedural motion called a discharge petition.  U.S. President Joe Biden called on U.S. lawmakers Tuesday to swiftly pass the aid package.  ""I call on the speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on,"" Biden told reporters.

""American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world,"" Zelenskyy said on X.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the measure is ""one of the most historic and consequential bills passed [in] the Senate. A bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, just the security of our allies, but also the security of democracy as we know it.""  He pointed to the bipartisan support and expressed confidence that a vote in the House would bring a similar outcome.  House Republicans have tied objections to further Ukraine assistance with a push for action on security at the U.S.-Mexico border.  Senate Republicans last week blocked advancing a measure that included the foreign assistance along with provisions to tighten restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of thousands of migrants from crossing into the United States each day.  Former U.S. President Donald Trump opposed the border measure, saying it was not tough enough, and Republican lawmakers followed his lead on the issue.  Some right-wing Republican lawmakers, many of them aligned with Trump, have also voiced increasing opposition to sending more aid to Ukraine for its fight against the Russian invasion, imperiling approval of the assistance even though most Democratic lawmakers are in favor.  ""We have already given Ukraine more than $120 billion. This is more than enough money to secure every border in our country. Unfortunately, but predictably, the $120 billion we've sent Ukraine has resulted in a yearslong stalemate that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, both Ukrainian and Russian,"" Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville said on the Senate floor Monday.  U.S. defense officials voiced hope that House lawmakers will approve the supplemental aid package soon, noting that Ukraine's forces are ""still in the fight of their life.""  ""Make no mistake — our allies and our adversaries are watching,"" said Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters Tuesday.  ""It's really important to send a message of resolve,"" she said, adding, ""as soon as we get this supplemental package passed in the House, [Ukraine] will continue to see aid flowing to them.""  U.S. and Western officials have said Kyiv's most urgent needs include air defenses and artillery.  But a report Tuesday from the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service raised concerns about how quickly the U.S. and its Western allies can supply Ukraine with what it needs.  ""It is almost certain that Western ammunition deliveries to Ukraine in 2024 will not be able to keep pace with the supplies available for the Russian Armed Forces,"" the report warned. ""Russia's advantage over Ukraine in terms of available artillery ammunition will likely continue to grow.""  Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-vows-rafah-attack-pulls-out-of-cease-fire-talks-/7488350.html,"  Netanyahu Vows Rafah Attack, Pulls Out of Cease-fire Talks  ","      February 14, 2024 8:15 PM      ",  By VOA News  ,"  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed again Wednesday to attack Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, even as he pulled Israel out of cease-fire talks in Cairo because he said Hamas had not changed what he described as “ludicrous demands” to halt the fighting.  The Israeli leader gave no indication when he might order his forces to attack Rafah. He said that hundreds of thousands of civilians now crammed into the region near the Egyptian border would first be allowed to vacate the area, although he gave no indication where they would go.  Netanyahu is under growing pressure from world leaders to not attack Rafah, but he said on his account on the messaging app Telegram, ""We will fight until complete victory, and this includes a powerful action in Rafah as well, after we allow the civilian population to leave the battle zones.""  Earlier, Netanyahu’s office said Hamas had presented no new offer in the Cairo talks to stop the four-month war and release more of the 100 or so hostages the militants are believed to be holding in Gaza. Hamas has been demanding that Israel withdraw all its troops from Gaza and allow the militants to continue to rule the territory along the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu has called for an “absolute victory” for the Jewish state.  ""A change in Hamas' positions will make it possible to move forward in the negotiations,"" Netanyahu’s office said.  Relatives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas said it was a scandalous decision by Israel to not send negotiators to the next session of the Cairo talks.  The move ""amounts to a death sentence"" for the remaining hostages in Hamas' tunnels, the group said, in a sign of growing domestic dissent in Israel about the war.  The Israeli military says it wants to attack four battalions of Islamist militants holed up in Rafah hideouts.  ""We are now counting down the days before Israel sends in tanks. We hope they don't, but who can prevent them?"" Said Jaber, a Gaza businessman who is sheltering in Rafah with his family, told Reuters via a chat app.  Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization representative for Gaza and the West Bank, said an assault on Rafah would be ""an unfathomable catastrophe ... and would even further expand the humanitarian disaster beyond imagination.""                  Palestinians fleeing the Israeli offensive on Khan Younis arrive at Rafah, Gaza Strip, Feb. 14, 2024.        French President Emmanuel Macron expressed similar concerns in a phone call with Netanyahu on Wednesday, days after U.S. President Joe Biden also voiced his opposition to a Rafah attack.  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said before talks with Netanyahu that people in Rafah with nowhere to go ""cannot simply vanish into thin air.""  At least 28,576 Palestinians have been killed, including 103 in the past day, and 68,291 have been wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7, according to the health ministry in Gaza.  The war started then with the shock Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 and led to the capture about 240 hostages, 100 of whom were released during a weeklong cease-fire.  A group of family members of people taken hostage by Hamas militants in the October attack on Israel is asking prosecutors at the International Criminal Court to bring charges against Hamas leaders.  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said its visit Wednesday to the court in The Hague would advocate for charges that “encompass taking hostages, enforced disappearance, crimes of sexual violence, torture and more severe allegations.”  Israel’s military reported new airstrikes Wednesday and ground operations in central and southern Gaza, including in the Khan Younis area that has been a focus in recent weeks.  International leaders have pleaded with Israel to hold off on a ground attack on the city of Rafah, nine kilometers south of Khan Younis, where many Palestinians have sought refuge from the war.  U.N. humanitarian chief Volker Turk warned that in Rafah “some 1.5 million Palestinians are packed against the Egyptian border with nowhere further to flee.”  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Tuesday, ""My sincere hope is that the negotiations for the release of the hostages and some form of cessation of hostilities to be successful, to avoid an all-out offensive over Rafah, where the core of the humanitarian system is located. And that would have devastating consequences.""  As it is, Guterres said, ""there is a breakdown in public order"" that is limiting delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced Palestinians, and he blamed Israel.

https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-vpn-usage-nearly-doubles-amid-internet-censorship/7488465.html,  China’s VPN Usage Nearly Doubles Amid Internet Censorship  ,"      February 15, 2024 0:35 AM      ",  By Evie Steele  ,"  WASHINGTON —   Last year, VPN usage in China nearly doubled, according to data from IT education news outlet Techopedia, this despite the country’s strict regime of internet controls of everything from overseas websites to online games.  China’s “Great Firewall” is one of the world’s most comprehensive internet censorship regimes, preventing citizens from accessing websites like Instagram, Wikipedia and YouTube, as well most major news organizations including VOA.  VPNs are outlawed in China because they allow users to jump the “Great Firewall” and securely connect to the internet outside the country while blocking their IP address.  Rob Binns, a journalist with Techopedia, said China’s increasingly strict censorship policies may explain the rise in VPN usage there.  “Looking at VPN usage versus what it’s combating, which is online censorship, we are seeing online censorship in a range of countries, particularly China, becoming more strategic and more surgical,” Binns told VOA in an interview.   In 2021, Chinese regulators limited teenagers’ access to video games to three hours per week — from 8 to 9 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays — before unveiling more severe restrictions last December which set spending limits on video game platforms and banned incentives for daily logins.  Binns said these regulations on minors may particularly motivate Chinese usage of VPNs.  “With that younger demographic, which is traditionally, extremely, highly tech-literate demographic, they're always going to be looking for ways to kind of circumvent that top-down pressure from governments and find ways to get around that,” Binns said. “And if that means turning to VPNs to circumvent that, then that’s certainly what we're seeing.”  Analysts say VPNs empower Chinese internet users to discuss major political issues on the internet without facing governmental blowback.  “Circumvention tools like VPNs can enable people in China to access the global internet, including spaces where they can express themselves freely without fear of censorship,” Kian Vesteinsson, a senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the nonprofit Freedom House, which advocates for political freedom, told VOA in an emailed response. “During unprecedented nationwide protests in late 2022, many Chinese people used VPNs to sidestep the Great Firewall and share their views on otherwise-inaccessible social media platforms.”  Vesteinsson said access to a free, open internet potentially threatens the ruling Chinese Communist Party — hence the government’s crackdowns on internet usage.  “Circumvention technology helped produce one of the most open challenges to CCP rule in decades,” Vesteinsson told VOA. “CCP authorities responded to the 2022 protests in part by scrubbing references to VPNs from the Chinese internet.”  “People face severe consequences for using prohibited VPNs, particularly if they belong to a marginalized ethnic or religious minority or try to access content censored by the authorities,” Vesteinsson added. “The government even removes discussion of VPNs from China-based social media platforms, preventing people from learning about circumvention technology.”  Analysts expect further crackdowns could lead either to additional upticks in VPN usage or a reluctance to use VPNs, depending on how China chooses to further enhance its censorship regime.  “The exact nature of the crackdown, as well as accompanying measures are what decides which effects it is likely to have,” Antonia Hmaidi, a senior analyst at the Berlin-based think tank Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA in an email. “China has been so successful in managing its internet partly through making the Great Firewall work not only with fear, but also friction and flooding.""  Hmaidi adds that instead of cracking down, China could also slow the speed of all connections outside the country, which would make it more inconvenient to use VPNs, and maintain an approved list of fast connections for companies.

https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-double-down-on-ties-despite-complications-in-trade-relations/7488511.html,"  China, Russia Double Down on Ties Despite Complications in Trade Relations  ","      February 15, 2024 3:37 AM      ",  By William Yang  ,"  TAIPEI, TAIWAN —   China and Russia have doubled down on their “no-limits partnership” in recent weeks, with leaders from both countries vowing to maintain “close personal interaction” and the Chinese ambassador to Russia revealing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plan to visit China this year.   During a Feb. 8 call, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin celebrated the deepened bilateral engagement and cooperation between China and Russia in various sectors and criticized what they called “U.S. interference in other countries’ affairs.”   In addition to the call between Xi and Putin, China’s ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, told Russian state media Sputnik Feb. 10 that Putin will visit China this year and that the two leaders are expected to hold several meetings during the year.  “Putin’s visit to China [this year] will definitely take place [and] China looks forward to his arrival,” Zhang said in the interview.   Some analysts say Beijing and Moscow hope to use their recent interactions to show the world they are “strongly aligned with each other.”   They want to show “that they have each other’s back because they both feel pressure from the U.S.,” Ian Chong, a political scientist at National Singapore University, told VOA by phone.  Since Russia and China share the goal of replacing the U.S. and weakening coordination between Washington and its allies, other experts say Beijing and Moscow believe that it is in their interests to further deepen bilateral ties.   “While there are frictions between Russia and China, they have been fairly successful in weakening democracies and exploiting their systems,” Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at London’s Royal United Services Institute, told VOA in a written response, adding that the relationship between China and Russia brings more positives than negatives to both countries.   Despite the mutual commitment to deepen ties, some recent developments may limit the degree of cooperation. Several media outlets reported that the EU is preparing to propose sanctions on three Chinese companies and four companies in Hong Kong for supporting the Russian military.                          SEE ALSO:      EU Eyes Export Ban on Three Chinese Firms             The sanctions would be part of EU efforts to close loopholes that may allow Russia to obtain military technologies required for its weapons manufacturing. In response to the news, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it considers the sanctions imposed by the EU “unacceptable.”   “China strongly opposes the application of illegal sanctions or ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ against China because of China-Russia cooperation,” the ministry said in a statement shared with some media outlets, adding that Beijing “will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.”   In addition to the proposed sanctions, some Chinese banks have reportedly either ceased operations with Russian or Belarusian companies or tightened regulations around transactions with Russia to comply with Western sanctions on Russia.                         SEE ALSO:      Chinese Bank Cuts Ties to Russian Importers             In response to the development, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said Moscow is confident that payment issues with China will be solved, adding that trade between China and Russia is expanding successfully.  Despite the closeness of their political relationship, some experts say the EU sanctions on Chinese companies and some Chinese banks’ reluctance to deal with Russian entities show that the commercial relationship between Beijing and Moscow is quite complex.   “Chinese businesses and the Chinese government are very careful about not getting punished by international sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU,” Philipp Ivanov, a senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA in a video interview.   He said that while diplomatic visits between the two countries will continue, Beijing will try to carefully manage the commercial activities between China and Russia.  “At the moment, it’s hard to see [recent developments] having a huge impact on trade [between China and Russia], but China may adjust its approach [to manage its trade relationship with Russia] in the mid- to long-term,” Ivanov said.   Since this month marks two years since Putin and Xi declared the “no-limits partnership” between China and Russia, Ivanov said the close bilateral relationship may have reached its peak. “Russia and China are politically and diplomatically very close and their economic and trade ties are growing,” he told VOA.   However, “since Russia can’t offer anything else to China apart from what’s already offering in terms of energy and commodities, there's not a lot else that they can do together,” Ivanov said, adding that one area to observe is how Beijing and Moscow coordinate their strategic interests.   As Switzerland prepares to facilitate possible peace talks on the Ukraine war, all sides are looking at how China positions itself in the process. Following his visit to Beijing earlier this month, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said he hopes China can contribute to the potential peace process by leveraging its close relationship with Russia.                         SEE ALSO:      Switzerland to China: 'Give Us a Hand' With Ukraine Peace Process            Despite the aspirations expressed by Switzerland, Chong in Singapore said China may prefer to maintain its vague position on Ukraine, which is that all parties will strive to “create favorable conditions for the political settlement of the crisis.”   “Both Beijing and Moscow may be betting on the possibility of former U.S. President Donald Trump returning to office [in November,] which could reshuffle things to the advantage of China and Russia,” he told VOA.

In an unusual move that caught some of his fellow lawmakers by surprise, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee publicly called on President Joe Biden to declassify intelligence on the unnamed threat so that the American public and its allies could formulate a response.  Republican Representative Mike Turner declined to elaborate. But in an email Turner reportedly sent to colleagues, shared on social media by various news outlets, he described the danger as a ""foreign military destabilizing capability.""  Several media outlets, quoting U.S. officials, reported late Wednesday that the threat involves a new Russian space-based capability.  But a U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence, said that while the danger is significant, it is not imminent.  ""The threat described does not involve an active capability that has been deployed,"" the official said.                  US President Joe Biden speaks at the White House in Washington on Feb. 8, 2024.        The White House also sought to downplay concerns, noting it was already set to brief lawmakers on some of the details Thursday.  ""I'm confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he is taking, is going to ensure the security of the American people going forward,"" said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.  ""We believe that we can and will and are protecting the national security of the United States,"" Sullivan told reporters, adding he was surprised that Turner took his concerns public since they were scheduled to meet for a classified briefing Thursday.  Sullivan also defended the decision not to make the threat intelligence public, pointing both to concerns about protecting U.S. ""sources and methods,"" and the president’s willingness to declassify intelligence in the past.  ""You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it's in our national security interests to do so,"" he said. ""This administration has gone further and, in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history.""  Some key lawmakers also pushed back.  The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, called the threat ""a significant one"" but ""not a cause for panic.""  ""As to whether more can be declassified about this issue, that is a worthwhile discussion,"" he added in a statement. ""But it is not a discussion to be had in public.""  The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise sought to allay concerns.  The committee ""has the intelligence in question and has been rigorously tracking this issue from the start,"" Democratic Chairman Mark Warner and Republican Vice Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.  ""We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration,"" they added. ""In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action.""  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson separately told reporters multiple times there is ""no need for public alarm.""  ""I want to assure the American people,"" Johnson said. ""We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We're working on it and there's no need for alarm.""  VOA's Patsy Widakuswara and Katherine Gypson contributed to this report.  "

That is the truth. And that is what resonates in the hearts of the American people. We are on their side. It's the side of common sense. It's the side of security, side of stability.”  But Democrats said the majority of the U.S. House of Representatives, including some moderate Republicans, want to debate and vote on the Senate legislation.  “All we're asking for is a vote,” House Democratic Chair Pete Aguilar told reporters Wednesday. “Over 300 members would vote for a package like that, but the question isn't for House Democrats. The question is for Speaker Johnson. What is he afraid of? To put national security first? To help our country push back against Putin and make sure that our country is protected? What is his concern?”  In a ""Dear Colleague"" letter Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, ""Traditional Republicans must now put America first, and stand up to Pro-Putin extremists in the House who apparently want Russia to win. The American people deserve an up or down vote, and we will use every available legislative tool to get comprehensive national security legislation over the finish line.""  House Democrats could force a vote through a procedural motion called a discharge petition.  U.S. President Joe Biden called on U.S. lawmakers Tuesday to swiftly pass the aid package.  ""I call on the speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on,"" Biden told reporters.  Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed the aid package by a 70-29 vote, with more than a dozen Republicans joining the majority Democrats in support.29 vote, with more than a dozen Republicans joining the majority Democrats in support.

""American assistance brings just peace in Ukraine closer and restores global stability, resulting in increased security and prosperity for all Americans and all the free world,"" Zelenskyy said on X.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the measure is ""one of the most historic and consequential bills passed [in] the Senate. A bill that so greatly impacts not just our national security, just the security of our allies, but also the security of democracy as we know it.""  He pointed to the bipartisan support and expressed confidence that a vote in the House would bring a similar outcome.  House Republicans have tied objections to further Ukraine assistance with a push for action on security at the U.S.-Mexico border.  Senate Republicans last week blocked advancing a measure that included the foreign assistance along with provisions to tighten restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of thousands of migrants from crossing into the United States each day.  Former U.S. President Donald Trump opposed the border measure, saying it was not tough enough, and Republican lawmakers followed his lead on the issue.  Some right-wing Republican lawmakers, many of them aligned with Trump, have also voiced increasing opposition to sending more aid to Ukraine for its fight against the Russian invasion, imperiling approval of the assistance even though most Democratic lawmakers are in favor.  ""We have already given Ukraine more than $120 billion. This is more than enough money to secure every border in our country. Unfortunately, but predictably, the $120 billion we've sent Ukraine has resulted in a yearslong stalemate that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, both Ukrainian and Russian,"" Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville said on the Senate floor Monday.  U.S. defense officials voiced hope that House lawmakers will approve the supplemental aid package soon, noting that Ukraine's forces are ""still in the fight of their life.""  ""Make no mistake — our allies and our adversaries are watching,"" said Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters Tuesday.  ""It's really important to send a message of resolve,"" she said, adding, ""as soon as we get this supplemental package passed in the House, [Ukraine] will continue to see aid flowing to them.""  U.S. and Western officials have said Kyiv's most urgent needs include air defenses and artillery.  But a report Tuesday from the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service raised concerns about how quickly the U.S. and its Western allies can supply Ukraine with what it needs.  ""It is almost certain that Western ammunition deliveries to Ukraine in 2024 will not be able to keep pace with the supplies available for the Russian Armed Forces,"" the report warned. ""Russia's advantage over Ukraine in terms of available artillery ammunition will likely continue to grow.""  Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.  "

One person was killed, identified by her radio station as a DJ.   Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves detailed the shooting's toll at a news conference and said three people had been taken into custody.   ""I'm angry at what happened today. The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment,"" Graves said. Police did not immediately release details about the people taken into custody or about a possible motive for the shootings. She said firearms had been recovered, but not what kind of weapons were used.   ""There's a lot of work ahead. This is just the beginning stages,"" she said. ""All of that is being actively investigated.""   It was the latest sports celebration in the U.S. to be marred by gun violence. A shooting injured several people last year in downtown Denver after the Nuggets' NBA championship, and gunfire erupted last year at a parking lot near the Texas Rangers' World Series championship parade.   Radio station KKFI said in a Facebook post Wednesday evening that DJ Lisa Lopez, host of ""Taste of Tejano,"" was killed in the shooting.   ""This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC community,"" KKFI said in a statement.   The shooting outside Union Station happened despite more than 800 police officers who were in the building and around the area, including on top of nearby buildings, said Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out.   ""I think that's something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about,"" Lucas said. ""Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe.""   Kansas City has long struggled with gun violence, and in 2020 it was among nine cities targeted by the U.S. Justice Department in an effort to crack down on violent crime. In 2023 the city matched a record with 182 homicides, most of which involved guns.   Lucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks.   Lisa Money, a resident of the city, was trying to gather some confetti near the end of the parade when she heard somebody yell, ""Down, down, everybody down!""   At first Money thought somebody might be joking. Then she saw a SWAT team jumping over a nearby fence.   ""I can't believe it really happened. Who in their right mind would do something like this? This is supposed to be a day of celebration for everybody in the city and the surrounding area,"" she said.   Kevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, said he heard what sounded like firecrackers and then people started running. After that initial flurry, calm returned, and he didn't think much of it. But 10 minutes later, ambulances started showing up.   University Health spokeswoman Nancy Lewis said the hospital was treating eight gunshot victims. Two were in critical condition and six were in stable condition, she said. The hospital also was treating four people for other injuries resulting from the chaos after the shooting, Lewis said.   Lisa Augustine, spokesperson for Children's Mercy Kansas City, said the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds.   St. Luke's Hospital of Kansas City received one gunshot patient in critical condition and three walk-ins with injuries that were not life-threatening, spokesperson Laurel Gifford said.

""We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today's parade and rally,"" the team said in a statement.   Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Parson and first lady Teresa Parson were at the parade during the gunfire but were unhurt.

https://www.voanews.com/a/private-us-moon-lander-launched-half-century-after-last-apollo-lunar-mission-/7488476.html,  Private US Moon Lander Launched Half Century After Last Apollo Lunar Mission  ,"      February 15, 2024 1:42 AM      ",  By Reuters  ,"   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida —   A moon lander built by Houston-based aerospace company Intuitive Machines was launched from Florida early Thursday on a mission to conduct the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half century and the first by a privately owned spacecraft.  The company's Nova-C lander, dubbed Odysseus, lifted off shortly after 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) atop a Falcon 9 rocket flown by Elon Musk' SpaceX from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.  A live NASA-SpaceX online video feed showed the two-stage, 25-story rocket roaring off the launch pad and streaking into the dark sky over Florida's Atlantic coast, trailed by a fiery yellowish plume of exhaust.  The launch, previously set for Wednesday morning, was postponed for 24 hours because of irregular temperatures detected in liquid methane used in the lander's propulsion system. SpaceX said the issue was later resolved.  Although considered an Intuitive Machines mission, the IM-1 flight is carrying six NASA payloads of instruments designed to gather data about the lunar environment ahead of NASA's planned return of astronauts to the moon later this decade.                  FILE - Women walk up a mountain with the full moon known as the ""Sturgeon Moon"" in the background, in Arguineguin, on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain, Aug. 1, 2023.        Thursday's launch came a month after the lunar lander of another private firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on January 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket making its debut flight.  The failure of Astrobotic's Peregrine lander, which was also flying NASA payloads to the moon, marked the third time a private company had been unable to achieve a ""soft landing"" on the lunar surface, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.  Those mishaps illustrated the risks NASA faces in leaning more heavily on the commercial sector than it had in the past to realize its spaceflight goals.  Plans call for Intuitive Machines' Nova-C vehicle, a hexagonal cylinder with four legs, to reach its destination after about a weeklong flight on February 22 for a landing at crater Malapert A near the moon's south pole.  If successful, the flight would represent the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since the final Apollo crewed moon mission in 1972, and the first by a private company.  The feat also would mark the first journey to the lunar surface under NASA's Artemis moon program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to Earth's natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.  IM-1 is the latest test of NASA's strategy of paying for the use of spacecraft built and owned by private companies to slash the cost of the Artemis missions, envisioned as precursors to human exploration of Mars.  By contrast, during the Apollo era, NASA bought rockets and other technology from the private sector, but owned and operated them itself.  NASA announced last month that it was delaying its target date for a first crewed Artemis moon landing from 2025 to late 2026, while China has said it was aiming for 2030.  Small landers such as Nova-C are expected to get there first, carrying instruments to closely survey the lunar landscape, its resources and potential hazards. Odysseus will focus on space weather interactions with the moon's surface, radio astronomy, precision landing technologies and navigation.  Intuitive Machine's IM-2 mission is scheduled to land at the lunar south pole in 2024, followed by an IM-3 mission later in the year with several small rovers.  Last month, Japan became the fifth country to place a lander on the moon, with its space agency JAXA achieving an unusually precise ""pinpoint"" touchdown of its SLIM probe last month. Last year, India became the fourth nation to land on the moon, after Russia failed in an attempt the same month.  The United States, the former Soviet Union and China are the only other countries that have carried out successful soft lunar touchdowns. China scored a world first in 2019 by achieving the first landing on the far side of the moon.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/enough-space-for-everyone-us-china-target-africa-/7388756.html,"  Enough Space for Everyone? US, China Target Africa   ","      December 22, 2023 1:33 PM      ",  By Kate Bartlett  ,"  Johannesburg, south africa —   As a new space race between the United States and China takes off, Africa is increasingly an arena for competition between the two superpowers. And so far, analysts say, China is ahead.  While Africa's space agencies are still in their infancy compared to those of the U.S. and China, analysts say space has become a new frontier for diplomacy with African countries.  ""In recent years, China has emerged as the leading partner with Africa,"" said Nigerian space scientist Temidayo Oniosun, who is the founder of Space in Africa, an analytics and consulting company.  Oniosun says there have been a lot of collaborations across sectors including communications, observation, navigation and positioning. China is developing satellites for different partners, ground station infrastructure, and is pushing for countries to adopt its BeiDou satellite navigation system, seen as an alternative to America's GPS.  ""Chinese companies have been capitalizing on this for years. It's now that the U.S. is waking up to this,"" he said during a recent forum on the topic at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington or USIP, a think tank founded by Congress.  ""U.S. strategy towards Africa in space is actually more about reducing the hegemony of China over Africa than anything else. … I think one of the major reasons they're [the U.S.] paying attention is because China is doing so much,"" Oniosun told VOA.  Asked whether the U.S. was indeed playing catch-up, a National Security Council spokesperson did not comment on Chinese competition directly, but said that ""U.S. companies are at the forefront"" of working with Africa.  The spokesperson detailed some of the agreements on space announced at last year's U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit, including Nigeria's partnership with U.S. firm SpaceX, which also helped Kenya launch its first operational earth satellite in April.  China regards Space X as competition  China sees Elon Musk's company as a major rival to its ambition to become a dominant space power by 2045.  Asked whether China was ahead when it came to space cooperation with Africa, a NASA spokesperson told VOA: ""The United States continues to work internationally for a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space. Working with both new and existing partners will add new energy and capabilities to help ensure the entire world can benefit from our journey of exploration and discovery.""  As one example of cooperation with Africa, the NASA spokesperson pointed to the U.S. agency's current collaboration with the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) on plans to build a new tracking and communications antenna site near Matjiesfontein, in the country's semi-desert area of Karoo.  ""NASA is currently finalizing negotiations for an agreement for NASA to build an 18-meter Lunar Exploration Ground Sites antenna to support the Artemis Program and the human lunar return to the moon,"" the spokesperson said.  U.S. led Artemis Accords is described as a ""set of principles designed to guide civil space exploration and use in the 21st century."" Other African countries have also been signing onto NASA's Artemis Accords, including Angola whose president signed the accords on November 30, during a visit to the White House.  View from Africa  According to a USIP report, co-authored by Oniosun, there are currently space programs in more than 20 African countries, and Africa accounted for 0.7 percent of global space expenditure in 2020.  Rather than seeking to participate in deep space exploration or human spaceflight, the report says many African countries see space development as a way of achieving national development goals and space-linked infrastructure as an important way to address problems such as climate change, national disaster preparedness and counter-terrorism.  A list sent to VOA by the South African National Space Agency, mentioned 11 partnerships with the U.S., including on deep space exploration, space education, space science research, hosting of Global Navigation Satellite System equipment, and six standing agreements relating to space operations.  ""SANSA also has long-standing working relationships with USA and Canadian researchers in space weather,"" Asanda Sangoni, acting managing director of SANSA Earth Observation, told VOA in a written response.  The agency has three projects or agreements with China on space exploration, satellite navigation, and general space cooperation, according to Sangoni.  Asked whether Africa is becoming one of the areas of competition in a new Cold War space race, Sangoni wrote: ""There is no single ""Space Race"" (if there is any) in the traditional sense.""  ""The global space landscape is evolving, with an increasing number of nations, including emerging nations, participating and often partnering in space activities. These nations pursue various goals and objectives based on their unique circumstances and interests, contributing to the overall development of space exploration and utilization,"" Sangoni wrote.  ""SANSA strongly believes that space-related activities should be inclusive and beneficial for all mankind. SANSA promotes the peaceful use of space and respectful cooperation,"" she added.  National Security Concern?   During the U.S. Institute of Peace panel, Joseph Sany, the vice president of the Africa Center, explained some of the perceived risks that are fueling the new space race.  ""As great powers vie for dominance in space, the risk of conflict between them looms large,"" he said. ""In an environment where space assets are essential for intelligence gathering, communication and military operation, disparities in capabilities could heighten tensions and create an atmosphere conducive to conflict.""  ""As competition intensifies, the trust and willingness to cooperate may diminish"" Sany said. ""Misunderstandings, miscommunications or deliberate disruptions in communication systems could easily escalate into full-blown conflict.""  The Pentagon's 2023 annual report to Congress on China's military developments makes numerous references to Beijing's ambitions in space.  The People's Liberation Army ""views space superiority, the ability to control the space-enabled information sphere and to deny adversaries their own space-based information gathering and communication capabilities, as critical components to conduct modern 'informatized warfare',"" the report states.  ""The PLA continues to acquire and develop a range of counter-space capabilities and related technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting space robots, as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor objects in space within their field of view and enable counter space actions,"" according to the report.  It's not just Africa where China's space industry footprint is expanding. A recent article in The Washington Post said the Pentagon is concerned that some of China's space and satellite programs in Latin America having defense capabilities.  The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred VOA's questions on its space cooperation with Africa to the Chinese Mission to the African Union, which did not reply to requests for comment.  "

The two-day benchmarking trip ended Wednesday, and Botswana’s Independent Electoral Commission’s focus was on “management of electoral activities and how to conduct elections.”  Utloile Silaigwana, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) chief elections officer, told journalists in Harare that the Botswana delegation will also learn about election publicity activities using radio and social media.  While Zimbabwe’s 2023 election was disputed, Silaigwana said Botswana’s visit is an endorsement of ZEC’s conduct of the elections.  But the Botswana National Front opposition is displeased with the IEC’s trip to Harare, arguing Zimbabwe is not an ideal model for the conduct of free and fair elections.  Ketlhalefile Motshegwa, spokesperson for the opposition Botswana National Front, expressed disappointment at the commission’s trip.  ""One would have expected the IEC to benchmark in more developed democracies and systems with effective electoral institutions as an indication that they really want to achieve excellence in their mandate,” Motshegwa said. “The mission of Botswana's IEC benchmarking in Zimbabwe is simple: Just to learn how to rig an election.”  Lawrence Ookeditse of the Botswana Patriotic Front shared similar sentiments.  “We know that Zimbabwe for the past two decades has not been in a position where they have run credible elections,” Ookeditse said. “The election has been stolen time after time. We see a situation where in the middle of an electoral process, the IEC in Botswana says they are going to Zimbabwe to benchmark. If you want to benchmark to run elections, you are not going to go to Zimbabwe.”  The IEC, in a statement released Wednesday, said the visit to Zimbabwe was specifically to look at ZEC’s accreditation machine for election observers.  International observers criticized a presidential election in Zimbabwe last August, saying it fell short of international standards and was conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation and fear.

https://www.voanews.com/a/us-north-korea-trying-to-advance-nuclear-program-with-satellite-launch/7372425.html,  US: North Korea Trying to Advance Nuclear Program With Satellite Launch  ,"      November 27, 2023 4:50 PM      ",  By Margaret Besheer  ,"  United Nations —   The United States accused North Korea on Monday of using the prohibited launch of a military spy satellite to try to advance its nuclear weapons program, a charge Pyongyang denied.  “The DPRK is unabashedly trying to advance its nuclear weapons delivery systems by testing ballistic missile technology in clear violation of this council’s resolutions,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  Pyongyang is prohibited by several Security Council resolutions from carrying out nuclear or ballistic missile activity. Thomas-Greenfield noted that North Korea has launched three Satellite Launch Vehicles this year and 29 ballistic missiles, including four intercontinental ones.  The United Nations said North Korea issued a pre-launch notification to the Japanese Coast Guard about its space launch vehicle but failed to issue airspace or maritime safety notifications to international sea and air organizations about its November 21 launch, which flew directly over Japan.  “The DPRK’s launches represent a serious risk to international civil aviation and maritime traffic,” U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Khaled Khiari said in his briefing.   Japan’s envoy condemned Pyongyang’s “appalling” and “reckless behavior.”  “The international community must express grave concern over such an irresponsible act by North Korea and take decisive action to address it,” Ambassador Kimihiro Ishikane said.  South Korea’s envoy said the launch was far from peaceful, as its northern neighbor claims.  “Any launch that uses ballistic missile technology, regardless of its success or payload, can contribute to the further advancement of ballistic missile technology, in particular ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear weapons,” Ambassador Joonkook Hwang said.   North Korea’s envoy defended the launch.  “It is a legitimate and righteous exercise of the rights to self-defense, which fully belongs to the legal sphere of our self-defense,” Ambassador Kim Song told the council.  He attributed North Korea’s need for such technology to the United States’ “hostile policy” toward his country and its joint military exercises with Japan and South Korea.  Washington has repeatedly offered to open talks with Pyongyang without pre-conditions.  “The DPRK can choose the time and the topic, but the DPRK needs to make that choice,” Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday.  China’s deputy envoy said if Washington is sincere about talks, it should build trust and stop engaging in “pressure tactics” such as the joint military exercises.  The council last adopted a sanctions resolution on North Korea in 2017. Russia and China have used their veto or the threat of it to prevent further council action.  Several council members also expressed concern about reported military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.  Thomas-Greenfield said U.S. information indicates that Pyongyang has provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions for its war in Ukraine.  "
https://www.voanews.com/a/here-for-the-long-haul-protesting-indian-farmers-set-up-camp-/7488606.html,  'Here for the Long Haul': Protesting Indian Farmers Set Up Camp   ,"      February 15, 2024 6:53 AM      ",  By Agence France-Presse  ,"  Shambhu, India —   Protesting Indian farmers relaxed inside their tractors Thursday as they awaited orders from leaders to advance on the capital, vowing they'd last longer than the police currently blocking their route.  ""We are here for the long haul,"" said Mela Singh, a 70-year-old from Punjab state's Mansa district, one of the thousands of farmers setting up camp on the highway after their column was stalled by roadblocks about 200 kilometers north of New Delhi.  ""A month, six months, a year, it does not matter, we will only retreat when we win this battle.""  Community kitchens and makeshift medical clinics have been established, while other farmers snooze beneath tarpaulins stretched over their tractor trailers.  Thousands of farmers this week launched what they have dubbed ""Delhi Chalo"", or ""March to Delhi,"" to demand a law to fix a minimum price for their crops, in addition to other concessions including the waiving of loans.  The demonstrations come ahead of national elections likely to start in April.  They echo ones in January 2021, when farmers used their tractors to smash through barriers and rolled into New Delhi on Republic Day during their then year-long protest.  This time around, their hundreds of tractors have been halted by fearsome police barricades of concrete blocks, rolls of razor wire and barrages of tear gas when the farmers come too close.  But the tense initial energy of the protest — marked by sloganeering and farmers using kites to ward off police drones dropping tear gas from the air — has given way to a more languid wait.  'Everyone's fight'  The protesting farmers are in no hurry to head back home.  Kamaljit Singh, 35, insisted everyone had a cup of the super-sweet milk tea he had on offer.  ""We have 100 liters of milk,"" said Kamaljit, a farmer from Punjab's Patiala district, saying his village had gifted the milk to support the protest.  ""Another 200 liters are on their way. We have enough for everyone.""  The milk is a symbol that all are behind the protest, he said.  ""Every person from the village has contributed,"" said Kamaljit. ""This is everyone's fight.""  Two-thirds of India's 1.4 billion people draw their livelihood from agriculture, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country's GDP, according to government figures.                  Members of the farm union Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) block railway tracks and shout slogans during a protest to demand minimum crop prices at a railway station in Rajpura on Feb. 15, 2024.        Nearby villages are making sure the protesters are well fed, drawing from the Sikh tradition of ""langar"", or community kitchen, and coordinated from village gurdwaras, Sikh places of worship.  ""In every village in the vicinity, gurdwaras have set up community kitchens where food is prepared round the clock for the farmers,"" said Sukhpal Singh, 63, also from Patiala.  Makhan Singh, a 60-year-old wheat farmer, used a roti to scoop up his breakfast of curry and pickled chilies — food donated by a village close to the camp.  The scent of fresh curry wafts towards the thick lines of baton-wielding riot police, who watch the camp from barricades across the highway.  ""The women in our village woke up at 3:00 am to prepare the food,"" said Mukhiya Singh, 32, who offered a curry of spiced tomatoes and potatoes.  Earlier this week, police alternated between raking the crowds with water cannon and dropping tear gas.                  Farmers rest near the Haryana-Punjab state border at Shambhu in Patiala district on Feb. 15, 2024.        That prompted medic Mandeep Singh, from Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, to lend his support at a makeshift medical clinic.  ""The tear gas is causing people respiratory troubles,"" he said, noting his supplies of antihistamines had already run out.  For now, the farmers await the outcome of another round of talks between union leaders and the authorities in Delhi.  Government efforts to pacify the protesters have met with little success so far.  ""What happens next will depend on the meeting,"" said Mela Singh.  "

The Keen Edge 24 computer simulation exercise was intended ""to practice responses in the event of a crisis or contingency,"" said the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command as it began the exercise on February 1. It ended Thursday.  It is part of an annual bilateral exercise that alternates with field training exercises Keen Sword. The Australia Defense Force participated in Keen Edge for the first time this year.  The U.S. and Japan named China as a hypothetical enemy for the first time in their exercise instead of a provisional name used previously, the Kyodo News reported Sunday, citing unnamed government sources.  The Japanese Defense Ministry reportedly classified the exercise scenarios under the country's secrecy law, Kyodo reported.  Pentagon spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Martin Meiners told VOA's Korean Service on Wednesday that ""we do not discuss specific exercise scenarios"" and that ""Keen Edge 2024 provides a realistic training environment"" for the U.S., Japan and Australia to respond to various crisis and contingency situations.  Lawrence Korb, former U.S. assistant secretary of defense and now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a telephone interview, ""The United States is working with our allies in the region to basically deal with threats from China"" and to warn Beijing against using military force to achieve its objectives in the region.  ""Gravely concerned""  In response to the Kyodo report, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said via email that authorities in Beijing ""noted the relevant report and are gravely concerned over the United States and Japan stuck in the Cold War mentality, putting together exclusive military blocs, and deliberately seeking bloc confrontation.""  He continued, ""Taiwan is part of China,"" and ""if anyone insists on interfering in China's domestic affairs and obstructing China's reunification, it will not only be a problem of 'imaginary enemy,' but it will pay a heavy price for that.""  China has been making assertive moves in the South China Sea since then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime foe of Beijing, visited Taiwan in August 2022.  China often flies its jets in a show of force over the self-governing island that it claims as its sovereign territory.  Chinese President Xi Jinping called for reunification with Taiwan in his New Year message delivered on the last day of 2023.  The U.S. and Japan held several naval exercises in the region recently.  They held a Multi-Large Deck Event in the Philippine Sea east of Taiwan, according to the U.S. Navy. The joint exercises were held January 29 to February 1, according to a statement by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF, on January 31.  The drills involved the nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Theodore Roosevelt, seven U.S. guided-missile destroyers and two U.S. cruisers joined by JMSDF helicopter destroyer JS Ise.  The U.S. and Japan also held trilateral naval drills with Australia in the South China Sea on February 7 and 8.  Ralph Cossa, president emeritus and WSD-Hana Chair in peace studies at the Pacific Forum, told VOA in an email on Tuesday that the command post and naval exercises were ""aimed at improving defensive (and offensive) capabilities against whatever threat comes along.""  He continued, ""In the case of U.S.-Japan, the most likely threat is China and North Korea, but the exercises are only 'against' them if they do something hostile toward the allies.""  He said it was important for the U.S. and Japan to demonstrate to potential adversaries such as China and North Korea that they have significant military capabilities ""to deter or defeat potential intended actions.""  The U.S. and Japan named China as a major threat alongside North Korea and Russia in a joint statement released after their Security Consultative Committee convened in Washington in January 2023.  They view Beijing’s strategy as ""aimed at reshaping the international order"" and oppose China's moves to seize Taiwan as well as Japan's Senkaku island chain, which China calls the Diaoyu Islands.  Japan's Coast Guard said on Tuesday that it had urged four Chinese vessels to leave its territorial waters near the islands.  The U.S. and Japan have been ramping up their efforts to deal with threats in the region, including any potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.  In addition to increasing its defense spending, Japan has been working with the U.S. to update command-and-control arrangements by establishing a permanent joint headquarters as well as improve allied capabilities in the southwest islands, according to Zack Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who served as a special assistant to the principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy at the Defense Department during the George W. Bush administration.  ""Each of those efforts would be useful in a Taiwan-related contingency but are also vital regardless of what the exact scenario is that might involve Japan,"" Cooper said.  "

The report by North Korean state media came a day after South Korea's military detected the North firing multiple cruise missiles into waters off its western coast, the third launch of such weapons this month. The event extended a provocative streak in weapons testing as North Korea continues to raise pressure on the United States and its Asian allies amid a prolonged freeze in diplomacy.  North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said that the weapon tested on Tuesday was the Hwasal-2 and that the launch did not affect the security of neighbors. The report didn't specify the exact numbers of missiles fired or the specifics of their flight performance.                  View of what appears to be a strategic cruise missile drill carried out by North Korea on January 30, 2024, at an undisclosed location in North Korea in this picture released by the Korean Central News Agency on Jan. 31, 2024.        The North has previously described the Hwasal-2 as nuclear-capable and that their range is up to 2,000 kilometers, a distance that would include U.S. military bases in Japan.  North Korea in recent years has been expanding its lineup of cruise missiles, which are designed to be fired from both land and naval assets. These weapons supplement the country's huge lineup of ballistic missiles, including short-range solid-fuel missiles aimed at overwhelming missile defenses in South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland.  Since 2021, North Korea has conducted at least 11 rounds of tests of what it described as long-range cruise missiles fired from both land and sea.  The North's two previous tests of cruise missiles on Jan. 24 and Jan. 28 were of a new weapon called Pulhwasal-3-31, which is designed to be fired from submarines.

Following that weapon's second launch on Sunday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reiterated his goal of building a nuclear-armed navy to counter what he described as growing external threats.  The North on Jan. 14 also tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, which underscored its efforts to advance its weapons that could target U.S. assets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.  Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim accelerated his weapons development to an unprecedented pace while issuing provocative nuclear threats against the United States, South Korea and Japan. The United States and its Asian allies in response have strengthened their combined military exercises and updated their deterrence strategies.  There are concerns that Kim, emboldened by the steady advancement of his nuclear arsenal and strengthened ties with Russia, would further ramp up pressure against his rivals in an election year in the United States and South Korea.  Experts say Kim's long-term goal is to force the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and negotiate security concessions and sanctions relief from a position of strength.

https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-north-korea-seeks-to-dominate-south-korea-through-nuclear-coercion-/7464411.html,  Analysts: North Korea Seeks to Dominate South Korea Through Nuclear Coercion  ,"      January 30, 2024 8:19 PM      ",  By Christy Lee  ,"  WASHINGTON —   Several prominent analysts are voicing doubts about a widely cited article concluding that North Korea has decided to wage war against South Korea, suggesting that Pyongyang’s provocative military buildup is more likely intended to win control over the South through intimidation.  North Korea test-fired another round of cruise missiles off its west coast on Tuesday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. This was the third cruise missile launch since Jan. 14, when the regime tested a hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile.   Two days after the Jan. 14 launch, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an end to his country's policy of seeking reunification with South Korea and ordered his nation to be ready to occupy South Korea if war breaks out.                          SEE ALSO:      North Korea Ends Policy of Reunification with South Korea            Two leading North Korea watchers wrote earlier this month that they believe Kim has already made a strategic decision to go to war against the South.   Robert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, both with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, said they believe Kim made the decision after determining that attempts to normalize relations with the U.S. have failed. They said Kim suffered ""a traumatic loss of face"" when then-President Donald Trump walked out of a Hanoi summit in 2019.   Carlin, a former chief of the Northeast Asia Division at the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, published their Jan. 11 article on 38North, a website focused on North Korea.  But other analysts say that while North Korea has been escalating tensions, it is not positioning itself for an imminent war with the South.   ""I don't see a deliberate decision to go to war on any kind of timeline in the next month or next year,"" said David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy.  Maxwell said he believes North Korea's goal — for now — is to engage in strategic political warfare to bring Seoul under Pyongyang's rule by manipulating the South Korean government and members of the public to become ""friendly to the North.""   Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, said an attempt to occupy South Korea by force cannot be discounted but that he believes North Korea's goal in developing and testing missiles and nuclear weapons is to intimidate Seoul.  Kim's ""ultimate goal is to dominate and control"" the South Korean government ""by coercion as opposed to by conquest,"" Bennett said. He believes Kim wants to be able to demand money from the South while manipulating its policies that threaten his legitimacy.   Bennett suggested the targets would include blocking the flow of South Korea's soft influence such as K-pop and K-dramas, the globally popular music and videos that penetrate into North Korea. Kim’s regime has taken a hard line against both, imprisoning and executing people caught enjoying South Korean entertainment.   A similar analysis appeared in U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) estimates that were declassified in June. They suggested that Kim is most likely ""to pursue a strategy of coercion, potentially including non-nuclear lethal attacks, aimed at advancing the North's goal of intimidating its neighbors, extracting concessions, and bolstering the regime's military credentials domestically.""   The NIC said Kim is more likely to use force, including nuclear weapons, to coerce rather than conquer South Korea.   Bennett predicted that if North Korea were to attack the South, it would do so by ""annihilating South Korea,"" possibly with nuclear weapons, rather than seeking to invade it. He said Kim is unlikely to send ground troops into South Korea where they could learn things that would undermine his legitimacy.  Maxwell said conditions that would lead North Korea to launch a war depend more on its domestic situation than external threats. Domestic political and economic instability that threatens his survival could prompt Kim to start a war using the pretext of external threats as an excuse.   Economic scarcity is already causing a political problem, as Kim acknowledged in a speech at a Workers' Party meeting on Jan. 23-24.  Kim said, ""Failure to satisfactorily provide the people"" with ""basic living necessities including condiments, foodstuff, and consumption goods has arisen as a serious political issue.""  The problem is not so acute as to pose a threat to his survival, but enough to make him want to divert attention from domestic issues, according to analysts.  Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said he disagrees with Carlin and Hecker about the threat of impending war. ""I am highly skeptical Kim really wants a high-level conflict because he values his own survival too much to attempt that,"" he said.  "

While North Korean cruise missile activities aren't directly banned under U.N. sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan. They are designed to be harder to detect by radar, and North Korea claims they are nuclear-capable. It also says their range is up to 2,000 kilometers, a distance that would include U.S. military bases in Japan.  Since 2021, North Korea has conducted at least 10 rounds of tests of what it described as long-range cruise missiles fired from both land and sea.  Tensions in the region have increased in recent months as Kim continues to accelerate his weapons development and make provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its Asian allies. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns as invasion rehearsals and uses as a pretext to further ramp up his military demonstrations.  There are concerns that Kim could dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.  South Korean experts and officials say Kim's weapons drive has put further strain on a broken economy, decimated by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions.  In a separate report, KCNA said Kim during a two-day ruling party meeting held through Wednesday criticized officials for failures in sufficiently providing ""basic living necessities including condiments, foodstuff and consumption goods"" to people living in the countryside and less developed cities and towns.  Kim had called the meeting to discuss a 10-year project he announced last week to promote a more balanced regional development, which includes a goal of building modern factories in every county nationwide.  Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press this week suggest North Korea has torn down a huge arch in its capital that symbolized reconciliation with South Korea, a week after Kim dismissed decades of hopes for peaceful reunification with the war-divided peninsula's south.  Kim last week described the Pyongyang monument as an ""eyesore"" and called for its removal while declaring that the North was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of the North's constitution to define the South as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Koreans of acting as ""top-class stooges"" of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.  Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its nuclear status.

The trip to the BAPS Hindu Mandir just north of the city of Abu Dhabi capped Modi's whistlestop tour of the United Arab Emirates during which the Indian leader embraced the UAE's president, describing him as a brother, and spoke before global leaders at a Dubai summit.   Modi is widely expected to win a third term as prime minister in the upcoming elections in India, the world's largest democracy. But Modi's policies and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party have raised concerns over India's future, particularly for members of its Muslim minority as they have come under attack in recent years by Hindu nationalist groups.   That has made warming Indian relations with the Muslim-led Gulf Arab states crucial not only for India's energy security and for millions of its expatriate workers in the region, but also its international standing.   Modi visited the temple in Abu Mureikha, built by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, or BAPS, a worldwide religious and civic organization within the Swaminarayan sect. Modi has close ties to the organization.   Modi walked past the temple's seven spires, a nod to the autocratic UAE's seven sheikhdoms. He looked inside the temple, where earlier Wednesday a priest had consecrated the statues of deities, each worshipped by different Hindu denominations across India.   The prime minister waved at a crowd of thousands gathered for the event, described as a Festival of Harmony, some spilling out into overflow seating outside. Children greeted Modi, and others cheered his movements through the temple with priests.                   India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi waves during a tour of the BAPS Hindu Mandir, the largest Hindu temple in the Middle East, at its inauguration ceremony on Feb. 14, 2024, in Abu Dhabi.        The temple effort extends back home for Modi. In January, he opened a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya.   That temple is dedicated to Hinduism's Lord Ram and had been wanted by Hindus who describe it as restoring a religion suppressed by centuries of Mughal and British colonial rule. But the 1992 demolition of the mosque at the site trigged riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.  Earlier Wednesday, Modi spoke before the World Governments Summit in Dubai, hosted by the city-state's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Much of the speech could be seen as a stump speech on the global stage.  ""Over the years, the trust of the people of the country on the government of India has become stronger,"" Modi said. ""People have full faith in both the intentions and commitments of our government.  ""It is as a friend to the world that India is moving forward,"" he said.  Modi's personal touch on the trip, including embracing Emirati President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, seems aimed at further cementing ties with the UAE, an oil-rich country that supplies India's energy needs while also serving as a home for some 3.5 million Indians.  The relationship also underscores the Emirates' realpolitik foreign policy. Modi received the Emirates' top civilian honor in 2019 even as he stripped statehood from the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.  "

This latest missile launch occurred just days after Pyongyang tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, equipped with a hypersonic warhead, into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.  “We harbor no hostile intent toward the DPRK and continue to be open to diplomacy without preconditions,” Patel added. He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is North Korea’s official name.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sharply criticized South Korea, describing inter-Korean relations as a relationship between ""two states hostile to each other.”  A major monument in Pyongyang symbolizing the goal of reconciliation with South Korea has been demolished, according to news reports citing satellite imagery.                  FILE - This photo shows the Arch of Reunification, a monument to symbolize hope for reunification of the two Koreas, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Sept. 11, 2018. The monument appeared gone in satellite images taken by Planet Labs on Jan. 23, 2024.        Earlier this month, Kim labeled South Korea as a “primary foe and invariable principal enemy,” stating that unification with South Korea was no longer possible.  This stance is viewed by some analysts as a departure from North Korea's longstanding objective of reunifying the Korean Peninsula under its control.  Pyongyang also continues to ignore Washington's offers for dialogue and remains averse to negotiating with Seoul.  U.S. officials have said they are disappointed by North Korea’s continued rejection of dialogue and the escalation of its hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. The United States said inter-Korean cooperation is vital to achieving lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.  “We are eager to engage in substantive discussions on identifying ways to not just manage military risk but create lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as our continued stated goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Patel said Wednesday.  At the Pentagon, Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters on Tuesday that Washington has been very public in its commitment to working with allies and partners “to deter and help stabilize the security of the region.”  The U.S., Japan and South Korea have reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK, in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The three countries also urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  North Korea last launched cruise missiles in September 2023. Two cruise missiles carrying mock nuclear warheads were fired toward the Yellow Sea at that time.  The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953. They remain technically at war as the Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.  Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.  "

John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesman, said the U.S. is watching “very closely” as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pursues advanced military capabilities from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday that Kim’s ability to benefit from this relationship is concerning, but the U.S. and South Korean defensive posture on the Korean Peninsula “is appropriate to the risk.”  Since July, when Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea, Pyongyang has been deepening its military ties with Moscow while escalating threats on the peninsula and calling for preparations to occupy South Korea if war breaks out.                         SEE ALSO:      North Korea Ends Policy of Reunification with South Korea            North Korea fired cruise missiles into the waters off its western coast on Wednesday, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

SEE ALSO:      South Korea Says North Korea Fired Several Cruise Missiles Into the Sea            Putin and North Korean Ambassador Choe Son Hui discussed bilateral relations in Moscow on January 16, according to Tass, the Russian state-owned news agency. It quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov the next day saying Moscow and Pyongyang “intend to boost relations in all areas, including sensitive ones.”  The most worrisome technology North Korea could seek from Russia would enable Pyongyang to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit into a ballistic missile cone, survive reentry and hit targets in South Korea, Japan and North America, said Robert Peters, a fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation.  “This technology is the last and the most critical step in North Korea fielding a credible nuclear strike capability and is well within Russia’s ability to share,” Peters told VOA via email.  He continued, “South Korea and the United States should prepare to face a North Korea that is technically more capable than it has been before.”  At an event in Washington hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on January 18, Pranay Vaddi, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, warned that the North Korean threat “could drastically change over the coming decade” as a result of military cooperation with Moscow.  “What we are seeing between Russia and North Korea is an unprecedented level of cooperation in the military sphere,” Vaddi said.  Last year, Putin turned to North Korea to replenish Russia’s weapons stockpile, which has been drawn down severely since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He met with Kim in Russia in September to discuss possible arms dealings.                         SEE ALSO:      Russia-North Korea Ties: Will Putin-Kim Bromance Last?            In October, Washington released satellite photos showing North Korea shipping more than 1,000 containers of weapons to Russia in violation of sanctions.  Artillery and missiles North Korea provided to Russia have been turning up in Ukraine, The New York Times reported on Monday.  John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said Russian technology transfers “would not so much change the threat as add to the atmosphere of tension on the peninsula.”  But he told VOA via email, “It will be important to keep defense and deterrence arrangements updated.”  In November, the U.S. and South Korea held an annual Security Consultative Meeting in Seoul, where they announced the revision of the 2013 Tailored Deterrence Strategy “in recognition of the changing security environment.  Their meeting followed a summit that U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held in April in Washington, where they announced the Washington Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.  Gary Samore, White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said in a telephone interview that weapons technology Pyongyang could obtain from Moscow could embolden it to raise threats but would not be a game changer requiring the revision of “fundamental deterrence” on the Korean Peninsula.  Samore, a professor at Brandeis University, thinks Pyongyang could seek enhanced technology to include surface-to-air missiles, spy satellite collection capabilities and advanced military fighter aircraft.  He told VOA that although Moscow would be “happy whenever there is trouble for the U.S.,” it would not encourage Pyongyang to cause conflict on the Korean Peninsula that would “jeopardize the flow of weapons to Russia” for its war in Ukraine.

And an analysis of commercial satellite images suggested that the North has torn down an arch in its capital that symbolized reconciliation with war-divided rival South Korea.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week described the Pyongyang monument as an eyesore and called for its removal while declaring that the North was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of the North's constitution to define the South as its most hostile foreign adversary.  The Wednesday missile launches marked North Korea's second known launch event of the year, following a Jan. 14 test-firing of the country's first solid-fuel, intermediate range ballistic missile, which reflected its efforts to advance its lineup of weapons targeting U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam.  South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korean militaries were analyzing the latest launches. It did not immediately confirm the exact number of missiles fired or their specific flight details.  ""Our military has increased surveillance and vigilance and is closely coordinating with the United States while monitoring for further signs and activity from North Korea,"" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.  Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have increased in recent months as Kim continues to accelerate his weapons development and issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its Asian allies.  NK News, a North Korea-focused news site, reported that Pyongyang's Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification, which was also commonly called the Arch of Reunification, appeared gone in satellite images taken by Planet Labs on Tuesday morning, although it was unclear exactly when or how it was taken down. The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm the report independently.  The arch was a 30-meter-tall structure that looked over a highway leading to the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea.  The United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises in response to the North's missiles tests. Kim characterizes these drills as rehearsals for an invasion.  In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea said last week that it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan, as it blamed its rivals for tensions in the region.  Cruise missiles are among a broad range of weapons North Korea has been testing in recent years as it attempts to build a viable nuclear threat against the United States and its Asian allies.  Since 2021, the North has conducted several flight tests of what it describes as long-range cruise missiles, which it claims can cover up to 2,000 kilometers and are nuclear-capable.  While North Korean cruise missile activities aren't directly banned under U.N. sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan, as they are designed to fly like small airplanes and travel along landscape that would make them harder to detect by radar.  There are concerns that North Korea could dial up tensions in a U.S. election year. Experts say the North would aim to increase its bargaining power as it plans for eventual negotiations with whoever wins the November presidential vote.  North Korea also has a long history of ramping up pressure on rival South Korea when it doesn't get what it wants from Washington.  During the speech at Pyongyang's rubber-stamp parliament where Kim announced that his country would no longer pursue reconciliation with the South, he accused South Korea of acting as ""top-class stooges"" of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.

In describing North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week, the North's Foreign Ministry said Putin also reaffirmed his willingness to visit Pyongyang and said that could come at an ""early date.""  North Korea has been actively strengthening its ties with Russia, highlighted by leader Kim Jong Un's September visit to Russia for a summit with Putin. Kim is trying to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.  In a separate statement on Sunday, the North's Foreign Ministry condemned the U.N. Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country's latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on January 14 was among the country's regular activities to improve its defense capabilities and that it didn't pose a threat to its neighbors.  South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council ""to break the silence"" over North Korea's escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia's war on Ukraine.  The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim's forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.  North Korea's Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a ""strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order.""  Russia expressed ""deep thanks"" to North Korea for its ""full support"" over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed ""serious concern"" over the United States' expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea's sovereignty and security interests.  Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable U.S. assets.  In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.  Choe's visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.  At Pyongyang's rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North's constitution to cement the South as its most hostile foreign adversary.

https://www.voanews.com/a/former-nato-chief-warns-against-axis-of-autocracies-/7447098.html,  Former NATO Chief Warns Against 'Axis of Autocracies'  ,"      January 19, 2024 11:25 AM      ",  By Natalie Liu  ,"  Anders Fogh Rasmussen served as secretary general of NATO from 2009 to 2014, after nearly eight years as the prime minister of Denmark. Rasmussen sat down with VOA’s Natalie Liu during a visit to Washington this week to make the case for continued strong support for Ukraine, while urging the free world to counter the advances of autocracies “led by China, joined by Russia, Iran and North Korea.”  Here are some highlights of their interview. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.  VOA: Are you in Washington this time to help push for more consensus on supporting Ukraine?  Rasmussen: One of the purposes of my trip to D.C. this time is to meet with members of Congress who are skeptical about continuing their support for Ukraine. I would tell them that it is in the American national security interest to ensure a Ukrainian victory and a Russian defeat. I would tell them that the Europeans are doing their part.  It would harm the American national security interest if Putin wins in Ukraine. It would encourage Xi Jinping to take Taiwan. It would strengthen the axis of autocracies under the leadership of China, but joined by Russia, North Korea and Iran, and it would weaken the alliance between the U.S. and Europe.                If we cannot trust American leadership, then it would fuel those voices in Europe that argue for a more independent European role as a mediator between Washington and Beijing. I think that would be a dangerous weakening of the transatlantic alliance. We should stand together with the United States. This is what is at stake.  VOA: Some argue that the United States shouldn’t direct so many resources to Ukraine and needs to ensure there are sufficient resources for potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific [caused by Chinese aggression].  Rasmussen: Obviously resources are limited, but we should never forget that the world's democracies represent more than 60% of the global GDP. If we stand together, if we are united, then we represent a formidable force, that [in turn] would create a lot of respect in Beijing.  We are faced with an array of adversaries at its strongest and most dangerous since the Second World War. We have seen an axis of autocracies emerge led by China, but joined by Russia, Iran, North Korea. Iran and North Korea are supporting Russia with missiles, with drones and in other ways. We have seen how Iran, how the proxies of Iran create instability in the Middle East. We've seen Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis who are threatening free navigation in the Red Sea. All these represent an axis of autocracies.  We in the free world have a clear interest in uniting, in standing together and countering these advancing autocracies.  VOA: How realistic is Ukraine’s prospect of getting an invitation to join NATO at the organization’s summit to be held this July in Washington?  Rasmussen: Well, I know it would be an uphill battle. We have to discuss it carefully. We have to prepare the details, and that's why I'm in Washington, D.C., because the U.S. will be a decisive actor in all this. Without American support for this idea to invite Ukraine, it’s not realistic. So, we have to discuss it with American legislators.  VOA: You mentioned you’ll be meeting with members of the Freedom Caucus [in Congress]. What are your hopes in communicating with them?  Rasmussen: I hope to convince them that it is in the national security interest of the United States to continue to support Ukraine. It's in their interest to ensure defeat of Russia, to challenge China, which they rightly consider a major global challenge.  And I know that's domestic politics, but I hope Democrats and Republicans could agree on a package which includes support for Ukraine, support for Israel, support for Taiwan, and an agreement on dealing with the border issues and immigration issues in the United States. A package that includes those four elements, I think, would be a very, very strong political signal to the whole world.  VOA: Some say that it’s not just some Republicans who are concerned about sending large sums of additional aid to Ukraine, but the Biden administration is not keen on entering into hot war with Russia. What are your observations as to how Washington thinks at this moment?  Rasmussen: My observation is there is a lot of skepticism across the board in NATO. That’s why we have to work hard.  Very often I hear the argument we cannot invite Ukraine to join NATO as long as the war is going on. That is an extremely dangerous argument to use because [in doing so] you are providing Putin with a de facto veto. That is also an incentive for Putin to continue the war to keep Ukraine from joining NATO.  Finland and Sweden concluded that neutrality in the traditional sense of the word does not exist, that gray zones are danger zones; this is the reason why they applied for NATO membership, and we should make exactly the same conclusion as far as Ukraine is concerned. That is a prerequisite for a more permanent peace and stability on the European continent.  Eventually, that would also free up resources both in the U.S. and Europe, to confront the real long-term global challenge, namely China.  VOA: The commander of Ukraine’s Azov special forces [Denys Prokopenko] recently wrote on Twitter [X] that he and his soldiers are realizing that they must be prepared to not only commit their youth, but their whole lifetime to fighting on the frontlines for the defense of their country. Is there a point in halting the war?  Rasmussen: There is a fair chance that Ukraine can win this war, provided that we are willing to give the Ukrainians all the assistance they need, all the weapons they need.  We should immediately lift all self-imposed restrictions on our delivery of weapons.  Until now, we have given a lot to the Ukrainians. But we have given them only enough to survive. What we should do now is to give them enough to win the war. You cannot win a war by the incremental, step-by-step approach we have pursued so far. If you want to win a war, you must overwhelm and surprise your adversary. And that's exactly what we should do.  "

North Korean state media KCNA said on Friday that the country tested an underwater nuclear weapons system in the waters off its east coast.  The test came after Pyongyang seemingly dismissed the possibility of peaceful reunification with Seoul by announcing on Monday the end of its reconciliation and reunification policy and called for preparing to occupy South Korea if war broke out.  At the same time, North Korea has been deepening its ties with Russia. Choe Son Hui, North Korea's foreign minister, returned to Pyongyang on Friday after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.

Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu in Washington told VOA on Friday, ""China firmly opposes the U.S. having any form of official interaction with Taiwan and interfering in Taiwan affairs in any way or under any pretext.""  He continued that the U.S. should not seek to use the Taiwan question ""as a tool to contain China"" or ""send any wrong signal to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces.""

China's languishing economy could encourage Beijing to become more cooperative with the U.S. on North Korea, one expert thinks.        China's languishing economy could also encourage Beijing to become more cooperative with the U.S. on North Korea, said Joseph DeTrani, former special envoy for six-party talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration.  ""The downturn, and China's need for more foreign direct investment, will moderate, to some degree, Xi Jinping's geopolitical assertiveness and influence China to be more cooperative on North Korea and, per U.S. requests, encourage North Korea to return to talks, initially, primarily with the U.S.,"" DeTrani told VOA via email.  On the other hand, Robert Rapson, charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA via email, ""We would need to see more improvement overall in the U.S.-PRC relationship before Beijing would use its leverage with Pyongyang, at U.S. behest, to dial back its rhetorical and strategic 'provocations.'""  Patricia Kim, research fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, holds a joint appointment to the John L. Thornton China Center and the Center for East Asia Policy Studies. She told VOA via email that Beijing is unlikely to take any steps to rein in Pyongyang even though China ""does not benefit from North Korea's saber rattling and rising tension on the Korean Peninsula.""  She said that is because Beijing's priority is ""to remain North Korea's most influential partner and to prevent others, including Moscow, from wrestling that position from itself.""  In the long run, however, China could welcome Pyongyang's escalation of tensions if it needs to distract the U.S. in the South China Sea, said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute at the University of London. Tsang and co-author Olivia Cheung recently published The Political Thought of Xi Jinping.  ""North Korea making trouble for the U.S. is in China's interest as long as it does not get out of control and risk war that China does not want — at least not until China is ready,"" Tsang told VOA via email.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the attacks must stop ""in order to maintain the smooth flow of global production and supply chains and the international trade order.""   China reiterated that the tensions in the Red Sea are linked to the war between Israel and Hamas.   ""The top priority is to quell the war in Gaza as soon as possible to prevent the conflict from further expanding or even getting out of control,"" Mao said.   Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, have said they are carrying out the attacks in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The violence has led U.S. and British forces to carry out retaliatory strikes against Houthi bases in Yemen.   Chinese, Russian vessels promised safety  The Chinese call Friday comes a day after Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong issued a similar appeal, calling on ""all relevant parties"" to ""ensure the safety of navigation in the Red Sea."" He said during a news conference Thursday the Red Sea waters are important international trade channels, according to Chinese state-owned news agency Xinhua.   A senior Houthi official said Friday that Russian and Chinese vessels would have safe passage through the Red Sea.   Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthi political leadership, said in an interview with the Russian outlet Izvestia that the shipping lanes around Yemen are safe to ships from China and Russia as long as vessels are not connected with Israel, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Izvestia.   China is the world's largest trading country and a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions. For many years, it has been the largest customer of the Suez Canal in Egypt, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and is the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.     According to data from the American Enterprise Institute, China's state-owned companies have invested almost $4 billion in Egyptian energy and logistics projects since 2007.  In the months leading up to Hamas' October 7 terror attack on Israel, firms from China and Hong Kong pledged at least $20 billion for various projects along Egypt's arterial waterway, according to Reuters.                          SEE ALSO:      Houthis Won't Target Chinese, Russian Ships in Red Sea            China relies on the Red Sea for transporting its crude oil imports from Iran and other countries in the Middle East, as well as its trade with the European Union.   Oil imports from the Middle East are key to China's economic lifeline. Official data shows that in 2022, China's crude oil imports from the Middle East accounted for approximately 53.5% of total imports. Among China's top five sources of crude oil imports, the Middle East accounts for four.   So far, attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have had almost no impact on the price of oil. Last week, international oil prices increased only by about 4%.   Ahmed Aboudouh, a nonresident fellow with the Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council, told VOA in a phone interview, ""At this point, we cannot see a massive harm to its commercial interests,"" adding that the conflict is small and isolated, not a regional configuration.   ""We might see this happening in the form of some extra charges or some extra insurance premium, some extra disruption to supply chains, but all in all, the damage is not huge,"" he said.   The Houthis have launched attacks on ships with no apparent connection with Israel, resulting in some shipping firms avoiding the shipping lanes where the Houthis have launched attacks.  As China has a naval base in Djibouti, at the mouth of the Red Sea, Julian McBride, founder and director of the Reflections of War Initiative, an anthropological NGO, told VOA in a phone interview, ""China could potentially do — especially now that China wants to rapidly expand their navy — they could escort a lot of ships from neutral countries that directly have economic ties to China without being potentially caught in the same operation as the United States.""

https://www.voanews.com/a/us-re-designates-yemen-s-houthis-as-a-major-terror-group/7443801.html,  US Redesignates Yemen's Houthis as Major Terror Group  ,"      January 17, 2024 10:30 AM        update    January 17, 2024 6:00 PM      ",  By Jeff Seldin  ,"  WASHINGTON —   The United States is cracking down on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, redesignating them as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group following weeks of missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.  The move came nearly three years after the Houthis were first designated as a terror group and then subsequently delisted because of humanitarian concerns, and it followed repeated demands from the U.S. and other countries for the Houthis to stop firing on commercial shipping.  But the demands have been ignored, and attacks have continued despite a series of airstrikes by the U.S. and Britain, aimed at taking out radar systems and launch sites used in the attacks.                         SEE ALSO:      US Launches Follow-Up Strike on Houthi Radar Site            “We cannot sit idly by and watch what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea and not recognize their actions for what they are,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters, briefing the condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.  “These attacks fit the textbook definition of terrorism,” a second official said, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity. “They have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners and our partners, jeopardized global trade and threatened freedom of navigation.”  U.S. officials point to about 30 attacks from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries.  Officials have also said that since the attacks started, some 2,000 ships have been diverted thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Additionally, Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.  On Tuesday, the U.S. for the first time carried out a series of preemptive strikes, destroying four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles before they could be launched.                That followed two waves of U.S. and British strikes last week against more than 60 targets in 16 locations across Houthi-controlled Yemen.                Houthi officials Wednesday described the U.S. designation as an attempt at “blackmail.”  “Whoever fails with aggression will certainly fail with a decision [of designation],” Houthi media official Abdul-Rahman Al-Ahnumi said in an interview with Reuters.  ""The decision came at this time after Britain and America launched a military aggression against Yemen and failed to achieve the same goal, which is to dissuade Yemen from its position,” Al-Ahnumi said. “It is also an attempt to dissuade Yemen from its position supporting Palestine and Gaza.”  But in separate statements Wednesday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Houthi attacks “unprecedented.”  “This designation is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis, further restrict their access to financial markets,” Sullivan said.  “The Houthis must be held accountable for their actions,” Blinken said.  Several U.S. officials, though, left open the possibility the designation could be revoked if the attacks cease.                “The ultimate goal of sanctions is to convince the Houthis to de-escalate and bring about a positive change in behavior,” one of the senior administration officials who briefed on the condition of anonymity told reporters. “If the Houthis cease their attacks, we can consider delisting designation.”  But the official added the U.S. is taking steps to ensure that the designation does not harm efforts to help Yemen’s civilian population, where the United Nations estimates 24 million people are at risk of starvation.  The re-designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group will not go into effect for 30 days, “to allow us to ensure robust humanitarian carve-outs are in place,” the official said.  The official also said commercial shipments to Yemen of for food, medicine and fuel would not be affected by the sanctions.  The designation, however, will block the ability of the Houthis to access the U.S. financial system and paves the way for other sanctions and law enforcement actions against the group.  U.S. officials said the ability to ensure to continuation of humanitarian aid played a role in the decision to label the Houthis with the SDGT designation.  They said designating the Houthis with the harsher Foreign Terrorist Organization, or FTO, label would require additional sanctions that could ensnare aid organizations trying to provide relief for Yemen’s civilians.  “We found in our conversations with groups that are providing humanitarian aid in Yemen that an FTO designation ran the risk of having a deterrent effect on some of those aid groups continuing to provide aid, worried that they might be charged as providing material support to a terrorist organization,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.  “So, when weighing those options, we decided that the SDGT designation gave us the tools to deny the Houthis access to the financial system, and gave us the tools to impose additional actions, additional sanctions, on anyone who does business with the Houthis, while minimizing some of the downstream harm to Yemeni civilians,” he said.  Some aid groups, though, have already raised concerns that the SDGT designation will hurt more than it helps.  “Even with carve-outs, there is likely to be a serious chilling effect,” the International Rescue Committee’s Anastasia Moran said in a statement. “We are concerned some private sector actors, including food importers and banks facilitating transactions for humanitarian organizations, may choose to disengage altogether.”  In contrast, some U.S. lawmakers are warning the SDGT designation does not go far enough.  “Designating the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist only applies sanctions and avoids taking any real action,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner said in a statement. “It’s time to lead and protect and call them what they are — a Foreign Terrorist Organization.”  Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen specialist at the University of Cambridge in Britain, cautioned that regardless of the type of terrorist designation, the impact on the Houthis was likely to be minimal.  “Houthi hardliners and leaders will see this as a badge of honor and continue business as usual,” she told VOA via email.  “They will not be the ones to suffer,” she added. “The war economy is booming and has enriched many powerful figures. The smuggling trade may even prove more lucrative following the designation.”  There are also questions about how the new designation will affect countries like Iran that have been supplying the Houthis.  “They [Houthis] currently use IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] funding, training and weapons to destabilize Yemen and engage in terrorist activities or terrorism that affects the region,” said a third senior administration official in response to a question from VOA.  “So, we will continue to also counter Iranian malign influence wherever we can,” the official said. “Of course, the choice to move away from Iran is now in the hands of the Houthis.""  The U.S. first designated the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as both an SDGT and a FTO during the last days of President Donald Trump’s administration in January 2021.

The Pentagon on Wednesday said the decision to designate the Houthis would not affect military operations in the region.  White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.

Iran's supreme leader is encouraging the Houthis, which serve as an Iranian proxy in the region, to continue attacking U.S. and western ships. Such attacks threaten to further exacerbate tensions in the region and the fragile economies of many regional states.  Yemen's Houthis attacked a Maltese-flagged vessel in the Gulf of Aden Tuesday, following a rash of attacks on international shipping in recent days. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who supports the Houthis, urged them to ""continue their attacks.""  Yahya Saria, spokesman for the Houthis' military forces, said they would continue attacking U.S. and British ships and seek revenge for U.S. and British attacks on their forces in recent days.  He says that [the Houthis'] naval forces carried out an attack targeting a U.S. ship in the Gulf of Aden using sea missiles and resulting in a direct and precise hit. He says that the Houthis consider all U.S. and British ships legitimate enemy targets after they attacked Yemen and that no new attack will go without a response.                         SEE ALSO:      Blinken Warns of Consequences for Continued Houthis Attacks in Red Sea            Yemeni analyst Salah al-Aghbar told Sky News Arabia that Iran is ""trying to assert that the Red Sea is a vital waterway to it and that it can close both the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz during a conflict, if the need should arise.""  Mehrdad Khonsari, a London-based Iranian analyst and former diplomat, tells VOA that Tehran is ""not capable of closing either the Red Sea or the Strait of Hormuz and that it is just using rhetoric for propaganda purposes.”  He argues that the Houthis are a useful proxy, but mostly a diversion from more important Iranian assets like Hezbollah.  ""Iranians, whilst they are cautious not to escalate the combat in a way that would involve them, or their primary proxy group, Hezbollah, they see the Houthis as a vehicle for increasing pressures on the world community without actually getting them involved in some kind of direct conflict with the west,"" he said. ""Now, if the Israelis were to attack Hezbollah, then obviously Iranians would become involved, but that is the kind of scenario that they would like to avoid.”  Khonsari adds that Houthi attacks ""dissuade Israel from going after Hezbollah and act as a very convenient diversion for the Iranians to direct attention away from more important areas to it, like the Lebanese border with Israel and Hezbollah bases, which are critical for the survival of Iranian regional policy.                         SEE ALSO:      US Envoy Expresses Hope for End to Hostilities Along Israel-Lebanon Border            If Hezbollah were attacked and degraded by Israel, he says, this would mean the collapse of Iranian regional policy and proxies, whereas degrading the Houthis or Hamas does not affect overall Iranian policy to a great extent.  Washington-based Gulf analyst Theodore Karasik tells VOA that U.S. and British attacks on the Houthis are clearly intended to degrade their military capabilities.  ""These strikes are important and meant to degrade the capacity of the Houthis, who are being backed by Iran, and that evidence is undeniable,"" he said. ""They are clearly linked, and consequently, such activity is going to continue to have an impact because of the back-and-forth and escalation process.""                         SEE ALSO:      US to Relist Yemen's Houthis as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, AP Sources Say            Karasik also insists that there is diplomatic wrangling taking place behind the scenes through various negotiating channels between key Gulf states, with lots of what he calls wheeling and dealing.  Yemeni analyst Fawaz Nasr, however, disagrees, telling Arab media that the Saudi-supported Yemeni government based in Aden, which opposes the Houthis, stresses that the U.S. and British attacks on the Houthis ""will have no effect whatsoever unless the Houthis are dislodged from territories that they control,"" including key parts of Yemen's Red Sea coastline.  Meanwhile, as many western ships and cargo vessels change course away from the Red Sea and Suez Canal for the longer Horn of Africa route, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met with officials with the French government's shipping authority to try to reassure Western shippers that the Suez Canal is safe.

The attack on the Gibraltar Eagle, later claimed by the Houthis, further escalates tensions gripping the Red Sea after American-led strikes on the rebels. The Houthis' attacks have roiled global shipping, amid Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, targeting a crucial corridor linking Asian and Mideast energy and cargo shipments to the Suez Canal onward to Europe.   The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which oversees Mideast waters, said Monday's attack happened some 110 miles (177 kilometers) miles southeast of Aden. It said the ship's captain reported that the ""port side of vessel hit from above by a missile.""   Private security firms Ambrey and Dryad Global told The Associated Press that the vessel was the Gibraltar Eagle, a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier. The U.S. military's Central Command later acknowledged the strike.                     ""The ship has reported no injuries or significant damage and is continuing its journey,"" Central Command said.   Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attack in a recorded television address that aired Monday night.   ""The Yemeni armed forces consider all American and British ships and warships participating in the aggression against our country as hostile targets,"" he said.   The vessel is owned by Eagle Bulk Shipping, a Stamford, Connecticut-based firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In a statement to the AP, the company acknowledged the strike and said it caused ""limited damage to a cargo hold but (the ship) is stable and is heading out of the area.""   ""All seafarers onboard the vessel are confirmed to be uninjured,"" the firm said. ""The vessel is carrying a cargo of steel products. Eagle Bulk management is in close contact with all relevant authorities concerning this matter.""   Satellite-tracking data analyzed by the AP showed the Gibraltar Eagle had been bound for the Suez Canal, but rapidly turned around at the time of the attack.   Central Command said it detected a separate anti-ship ballistic missile launch toward the southern Red Sea on Monday, though it ""failed in flight and impacted on land in Yemen.""   The U.S. Maritime Administration, under the Transportation Department, also issued a warning Monday saying there continues to be ""a high degree of risk to commercial vessels"" traveling near Yemen.   ""While the decision to transit remains at the discretion of individual vessels and companies, it is recommended that U.S. flag and U.S.-owned commercial vessels"" stay away from Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ""until further notice,"" the advisory said.   Sunday's missile launch toward the American warship also marked the first U.S.-acknowledged fire by the Houthis since America and allied nations began strikes Friday on the rebels following weeks of assaults on shipping in the Red Sea.   The Houthi fire in the direction of the USS Laboon, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer operating in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, Central Command said.                   FILE - Guided missile destroyer USS Laboon is under way in the Atlantic Ocean, March 12, 2012.        The missile came from near Hodeida, a Red Sea port city long held by the Houthis, the U.S. said.   ""An anti-ship cruise missile was fired from Iranian-backed Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward USS Laboon,"" Central Command said. ""There were no injuries or damage reported.""   The Houthis did not acknowledge that attack.   It wasn't presently clear whether the U.S. would retaliate for the latest attacks, though President Joe Biden has said he ""will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.""   The first day of U.S.-led strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets with cruise missiles and bombs launched by fighter jets, warships and a submarine. Sites hit included weapon depots, radars and command centers, including in remote mountain areas, the U.S. has said.   The Houthis have yet to acknowledge how severe the damage was from the strikes, which they said killed five of their troops and wounded six others.   U.S. forces followed up with a strike Saturday on a Houthi radar site.  Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel's offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.  Even the leader of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, obliquely referenced the widening Houthi attacks on ships in a speech Sunday, saying that ""the sea has become a battlefield of missiles, drones and warships"" and blaming the U.S. strikes for escalating maritime tensions.   ""The most dangerous thing is what the Americans did in the Red Sea, (it) will harm the security of all maritime navigation,"" Nasrallah said.   Though the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes in the Red Sea threaten to ignite one.  It's also affecting shipping for the Middle East nation of Qatar, one of the world's top natural gas suppliers. Three liquid natural gas tankers that had recently loaded in Qatar and were bound for the Suez Canal remain idling off Oman, while another coming from Europe to Qatar remains off Saudi Arabia. QatarEnergy and government officials did not respond to a request for comment.  Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemeni government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting, sought to distance itself from the attacks on Houthi sites as it tries to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that began in 2015 has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.

https://www.voanews.com/a/us-launches-follow-up-strike-on-houthi-radar-site-/7438870.html,  US Launches Follow-Up Strike on Houthi Radar Site  ,"      January 13, 2024 3:44 PM      ",  By Jeff Seldin  ,"  washington —   The United States launched a follow-up strike against a Houthi target in Yemen early Saturday, after officials said they were not satisfied with the damage inflicted during the initial round of airstrikes late Thursday.   U.S. Central Command said it launched the additional strike from the USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer, firing multiple Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out a radar site that it said presented a continuing threat to maritime traffic.   The strike comes a little more than a day after the U.S. and British militaries carried out dozens of strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen in retaliation for weeks of Houthi attacks that have disrupted shipping and damaged vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.   Early Friday, Houthi militants launched an anti-ship ballistic missile, U.S. military officials confirmed, though it did not hit any ships.   U.S. and British officials had expressed optimism Friday that the initial strikes late Thursday, which are now being described as two waves of strikes, were successful.   A U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday that the initial assessment indicates the first wave of precision strikes late on Thursday degraded the ability of the Houthis to launch further attacks.   The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss operational details, said a more comprehensive assessment of the strikes was still underway. But the sentiment echoed other early assessments by senior U.S. officials, who have described the damage to Houthi capabilities as ""significant.""   ""We feel very confident about where our munitions struck,"" Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters Friday. ""But we don't know at this point the complete battle damage assessment.""   More than 150 munitions aimed at Houthis  U.S. Central Command late Thursday said that U.S. fighter jets, naval vessels and submarines hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations across Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.   But, Sims said Friday, the U.S. and Britain launched a second wave of strikes against another 12 locations 30 minutes to an hour after the initial strikes were carried out.   The additional sites, each with multiple targets, ""had been identified as possessing articles that could be potentially used against forces, maritime and air,"" he said, noting the strikes were taken in self-defense.  U.S. officials said, in all, more than 150 precision guided munitions were aimed at Houthi targets, including Tomahawk missiles.                   Yemen        At least three U.S. guided missile cruisers and destroyers — the USS Gravely, the USS Philippine Sea, and the USS Mason — took part in the strikes along with an Ohio-class submarine, fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, and U.S. Air Force jets.   A separate statement Friday from the British Defense Ministry said four of its Typhoon fighter jets, accompanied by an air refueling tanker, used laser-guided bombs to hit two locations: a drone launch site in Bani, in northwestern Yemen, and an airfield in Abbs used to launch cruise missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea.   ""Early indications are that the Houthis' ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow,"" the ministry said.   Retaliation likely, say US officials   Despite the optimistic strike assessments, U.S. officials said they believe the Houthis are likely to retaliate.   ""My guess is that the Houthis are trying to figure things out on the ground and trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them,"" Sims said. ""Their rhetoric has been pretty strong and pretty high, and I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation.""   ""I would hope they wouldn't,"" he added, describing the Houthi efforts as ""generally fruitless.""   But the White House repeated its warning Friday that the Houthis would face additional consequences if their attacks persisted.   ""We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior, along with our allies,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said in response to reporters' questions during a stop at a coffee shop in Pennsylvania on Friday.   Reporters asked him if the Houthis are terrorists, and he replied, ""I think they are."" In 2021, his administration removed the Houthis from the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations.   Also Friday, the U.S. unveiled new sanctions aimed at commodity shipments that have been funding the Houthis and their Iranian backers.   U.S. Treasury Department officials imposed sanctions on a Hong-Kong-based company and another company in the United Arab Emirates, both of which have been working with Sa'id al-Jamal, a financier who has been supporting both the Houthis and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.   ""We will take all available measures to stop the destabilizing activities of the Houthis and their threats to global commerce,"" Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said in a statement.   Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 28 attacks, affecting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.   U.S. officials have said that Biden made the decision to launch Thursday's strikes following a Houthi attack on shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden on Tuesday that involved 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile.   U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.

https://www.voanews.com/a/us-launches-follow-up-strike-on-houthi-radar-site-/7438462.html,  US Launches Follow-Up Strike on Houthi Radar Site  ,"      January 12, 2024 11:27 PM      ",  By Jeff Seldin  ,"  WASHINGTON —   The United States launched a follow-up strike against a Houthi target in Yemen early Saturday, after officials said they were not satisfied with the damage inflicted during the initial round of airstrikes late Thursday.  U.S. Central Command said it launched the additional strike from the USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer, firing multiple Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out a radar site that it said presented a continuing threat to maritime traffic.  The strike comes a little more than a day after the U.S. and British militaries carried out dozens of strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen, in retaliation for weeks of Houthi attacks that have disrupted shipping and damaged vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.  Houthi militants did launch an anti-ship ballistic missile early Friday, U.S. military officials confirmed, though it did not hit any ships.  U.S. and British officials expressed optimism Friday that the initial strikes late Thursday, which are now being described as two waves of strikes, were successful.  A U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday that the initial assessment indicates the first wave of precision strikes late Thursday degraded the ability of the Houthis to launch further attacks.  The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss operational details, said a more comprehensive assessment of the strikes was still underway. But the sentiment echoed other early assessments by senior U.S. officials, who have described the damage to Houthi capabilities as ""significant.""   ""We feel very confident about where our munitions struck,"" Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters Friday. ""But we don't know at this point the complete battle damage assessment.""                  Yemen        U.S. Central Command late Thursday said that U.S. fighter jets, naval vessels and submarines hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations across Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.  But Sims said Friday, the U.S. and Britain launched a second wave of strikes against another 12 locations 30 minutes to an hour after the initial strikes were carried out.  The additional sites, each with multiple targets, ""had been identified as possessing articles that could be potentially used against forces, maritime and air,"" he said, noting the strikes were taken in self-defense.  U.S. officials said, in all, more than 150 precision guided munitions were aimed at Houthi targets, including Tomahawk missiles.  At least three U.S. guided missile cruisers and destroyers (the USS Gravely, the USS Philippine Sea, and the USS Mason) took part in the strikes along with an Ohio-class submarine, fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, and U.S. Air Force jets.  A separate statement Friday from the British Defense Ministry said four of its Typhoon fighter jets, accompanied by an air refueling tanker, used laser-guided bombs to hit two locations: a drone launch site in Bani, in northwestern Yemen, and an airfield in Abbs, used to launch cruise missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea.  ""Early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow,"" the ministry said.  Despite the optimistic strike assessments, U.S. officials have said they believe the Houthis are likely to retaliate.  ""My guess is that the Houthis are trying to figure things out on the ground and trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them,"" Sims said. ""Their rhetoric has been pretty strong and pretty high, and I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation.""  ""I would hope they wouldn’t,"" he added, describing the Houthi efforts as ""generally fruitless.""  But the White House repeated its warning Friday that the Houthis would face additional consequences if their attacks persist.  ""We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior, along with our allies,"" President Joe Biden said in response to reporters’ questions during a stop at a coffee shop in Pennsylvania on Friday.  Also Friday, the U.S. unveiled new sanctions aimed at commodity shipments that have been funding the Houthis and their Iranian backers.  U.S. Treasury Department officials imposed sanctions on a Hong-Kong-based company and another company in the United Arab Emirates, both of which have been working with Sa’id al-Jamal, a financier who has been supporting both the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.  ""We will take all available measures to stop the destabilizing activities of the Houthis and their threats to global commerce,"" Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said in a statement.  Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 28 attacks, affecting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.  U.S. officials have said that Biden made the decision to launch Thursday’s strikes following a Houthi attack on shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden on Tuesday that involved 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile.  U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.

https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-defends-itself-at-the-un-s-top-court-against-gaza-genocide-allegations-/7438408.html,  Israel Defends Itself at the UN's Top Court Against Gaza Genocide Allegations  ,"      January 12, 2024 8:51 PM      ",  By Associated Press  ,"  THE HAGUE, Netherlands —   Accused of committing genocide against Palestinians, Israel insisted at the United Nations' highest court Friday that its war in Gaza was a legitimate defense of its people and that it was Hamas militants who were guilty of genocide.  Israel described the allegations leveled by South Africa as hypocritical and said one of the biggest cases ever to come before an international court reflected a world turned upside down. Israeli leaders defend their air and ground offensive in Gaza as a legitimate response to Hamas' October 7 attack, when militants stormed through Israeli communities, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.  Israeli legal advisor Tal Becker told a packed auditorium at the ornate Palace of Peace in The Hague that the country is fighting a ""war it did not start and did not want.""  ""In these circumstances, there can hardly be a charge more false and more malevolent than the allegation against Israel of genocide,"" he added, noting that the horrible suffering of civilians in war was not enough to level that charge.  On Friday afternoon, Germany said it wants to intervene in the proceedings on Israel's behalf, saying there was ""no basis whatsoever"" for an accusation of genocide against Israel.  ""Hamas terrorists brutally attacked, tortured, killed and kidnapped innocent people in Israel,"" German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement. ""Since then, Israel has been defending itself against the inhumane attack by Hamas.""  Under the court's rules, if Germany files a declaration of intervention in the case, it will be able to make legal arguments on behalf of Israel.                  Judges and parties sit during a hearing at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 12, 2024.        Germany would be allowed to intervene at the merits phase of the case to address how the genocide convention, drawn up in 1948 following World War II, should be interpreted, according to international lawyer Balkees Jarrah, associate director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch.  ""That would come after the court issues its decision on South Africa's request for urgent measures to protect the Palestinian people in Gaza,"" Jarrah told The Associated Press from The Hague, where she attended the ICJ hearings.  Germany's support for Israel carries some symbolic significance given its Nazi history.  Hebestreit said Germany ""sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide."" He added: ""We firmly oppose political instrumentalization.""  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the announcement, saying the gesture ""touches all of Israel's citizens.""  South African lawyers asked the court Thursday to order an immediate halt to Israeli military operations in the besieged coastal territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians. A decision on that request will probably take weeks, and the full case is likely to last years — and it's unclear if Israel would follow any court orders.  On Friday, Israel focused on the brutality of the October 7 attacks, presenting chilling video and audio to a hushed audience.  ""They tortured children in front of parents and parents in front of children, burned people, including infants alive, and systematically raped and mutilated scores of women, men and children,"" Becker said.  South Africa's request for an immediate halt to the Gaza fighting, he said, amounts to an attempt to prevent Israel from defending itself against that assault.  Even when acting in self-defense, countries are required by international law to follow the rules of war, and judges must decide if Israel has.  As two days of hearings ended Friday, ICJ President Joan E. Donoghue said the court would rule on the request for urgent measures ""as soon as possible.""  Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, Israeli leaders took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously they regard the case and likely their fear that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country's international standing.  Still, Becker dismissed the accusations as crude and attention-seeking.  ""We live at a time when words are cheap in an age of social media and identity politics. The temptation to reach for the most outrageous term to vilify and demonize has become, for many, irresistible,"" he said.                  Protesters carry flags and banners outside the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 12, 2024.        In a statement from New York, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called the case a ""new moral low"" and said that by taking it on, ""the U.N. and its institutions have become weapons in service of terrorist organizations.""  Becker said the charges Israel is facing should be leveled at Hamas, which seeks Israel's destruction and which the U.S. and Western allies consider a terrorist group.  ""If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel,"" Becker said.  More than 23,000 people in Gaza have been killed during Israel's military campaign, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory. That toll does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Nearly 85% of Gaza's people have been driven their homes, a quarter of the enclave's residents face starvation, and much of northern Gaza has been reduced to rubble.  South Africa says this amounts to genocide and is part of decades of Israeli oppression of Palestinians.  ""The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,"" said lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, adding that several leading politicians had made dehumanizing comments about people in Gaza.  The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry welcomed the case, saying in a written statement that South Africa ""delivered unequivocal evidence that Israel is deliberately and systematically violating its obligations under the Genocide Convention.""  Israel says that it takes measures to protect civilians, such as issuing evacuation orders ahead of strikes. It blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the group uses residential areas to stage attacks and for other military purposes.  The case also strikes at the heart of both Israel's and South Africa's national identities.  Israel was founded as a Jewish state in the wake of the Nazis' slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II. South Africa's governing party, meanwhile, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to ""homelands.""  The world court, which rules on disputes between nations, has never judged a country to be responsible for genocide. The closest it came was in 2007, when it ruled that Serbia ""violated the obligation to prevent genocide"" in the July 1995 massacre by Bosnian Serb forces of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica.

https://www.voanews.com/a/who-are-the-houthis-and-why-did-the-us-and-uk-launch-strikes-on-them-/7437022.html,  Who Are the Houthis and Why Did the US and UK Launch Strikes on Them?  ,"      January 12, 2024 4:50 AM      ",  By Associated Press  ,"  WASHINGTON —   When U.S. and U.K. warships and aircraft launched waves of missiles at Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen early Friday in Sanaa, it capped weeks of warnings to the group to cease their drone and missile attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea or face severe consequences.  Previously the U.S. had withheld striking back, reflecting larger U.S. concerns about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. But on Tuesday the Houthis launched their largest-ever barrage of 18 one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and an anti-ship ballistic missile at a host of international commercial vessels and warships in the Red Sea.  While the U.S. and partner military ships and aircraft now protecting the waterways were able to deflect Tuesday's attack, the scope and severity of the launch drew international condemnation and left few options other than to carry through with international warnings that any further attacks would draw a substantial response.  In response, the U.S. and U.K. struck Houthi missile, radar and drone capabilities to degrade the group's ability to conduct more attacks like Tuesday's barrage.  In response to the strikes, which occurred in Yemen just before Friday 3 a.m. local time, the rebel group has already pledged to retaliate. Later in the day, the Houthis said the strikes killed five people and wounded six, without elaborating on who the casualties were.  Here's a look at the Houthis and their increasing attacks, and why the U.S. believes it is more acceptable to bomb some Iranian-linked targets than others.  Who are the Houthis?  Houthi rebels swept down from their northern stronghold in Yemen and seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, launching a grinding war. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore Yemen's exiled, internationally recognized government to power.  Years of bloody, inconclusive fighting against the Saudi-led coalition settled into a stalemated proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, causing widespread hunger and misery in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.  A cease-fire that technically ended more than a year ago is still largely being honored. Saudi Arabia and the rebels have done some prisoner swaps, and a Houthi delegation was invited to high-level peace talks in Riyadh in September as part of a wider détente the kingdom has reached with Iran. While they reported ""positive results,"" there is still no permanent peace.  Attacks on ships  The Houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region over time, but the attacks have increased since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas and spiked after an explosion October 17 at a hospital in Gaza killed and injured many. That hospital blast marked the beginning of an intense militant campaign against U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, and on many commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea. The attacks have damaged commercial ships and forced international shipping companies to divert their vessels around the Cape of Good Hope.                  FILE - Shiite fighters, known as Houthis, hold up their weapons as they chant slogans at the residence of a military commander of the Houthi militant group, destroyed by a Saudi-led airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen, April 28, 2015.        As of Thursday the Houthis had launched 27 different attacks on vessels transiting the Southern Red Sea, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a Pentagon press conference.  Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree has said the group wants to ""prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea (and Gulf of Aden) until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops.""  But few of the ships targeted have had direct links to Israel. In a recent attack, one of the commercial ships hit — the Unity Explorer — had a tenuous Israeli link. It is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who lives in Israel, as one of its officers. Israeli media identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli shipping billionaire Abraham ""Rami"" Ungar. But any Israel connections to other ships are unclear.  U.S. officials have argued that the Houthis haven't technically targeted U.S. military vessels or forces — a subtlety that Navy ship captains watching the incoming drones may question.  In response to the attacks, last month Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Operation Prosperity Guardian, where the U.S. and more than 20 other countries have created a protective umbrella for the commercial vessels that are not re-routing and decide to transit the Red Sea.  If that operation had not provided escort the commercial vessels and intercepted the incoming fire, ""we have no doubt that ships would have been struck, perhaps even sunk, including in one case a commercial ship full of jet fuel,"" a senior administration official told reporters late Thursday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the strikes. ""We've had extremely close calls.""  To date Operation Prosperity Guardian has helped more than 1,500 commercial vessels safely transit the Red Sea.  The US calculus  While the U.S. has carried out airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria that have targeted American troops in 130 different attacks since October 17, until Thursday the military had not yet retaliated against the Houthis.  That reluctance reflects political sensitivities and stems largely from broader Biden administration concerns about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. The White House wants to preserve the truce and is wary of taking action that could open up another war front.  Iran-backed militias have launched one-way attack drones, rockets or close-range ballistic missiles at bases in Iraq 53 times and in Syria 77 times. Dozens of troops have suffered injuries as a result of the attacks, in many cases traumatic brain injuries.  In response, the U.S. has retaliated with airstrikes multiple times in Syria since October 17, targeting weapons depots and other facilities linked directly to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and the militias. And it struck multiple sites in Iraq late last month after a militia group for the first time fired short-range ballistic missiles at U.S. forces at Al-Asad air base.  But until Thursday, striking the Houthis had been a different calculus.  In one breath, Pentagon officials had said Navy ships shot down Houthi drones heading toward them because they were deemed ""a threat."" But in the next breath officials said the U.S. had assessed that the ships were not the target. That determination often comes later after intelligence assessments review telemetry and other data.  That, however, is certainly no comfort to sailors on the ships who watch the radar track of incoming drones and must make rapid decisions about whether they represent threats to the ship.  At the same time, the U.S. has consistently said it wants to protect free navigation of the seas. But the Houthi actions have prompted the International Maritime Security Construct to issue a warning for ships transiting the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb. It says ships should choose routes as far from Yemeni waters as possible, travel at night and not stop, because that makes them an easier target.  The Biden administration has talked persistently about the need to avoid escalating the Israel-Hamas war into a broader regional conflict. So far, strikes on the Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have not broadened the conflict, said Ryder.  It's not clear if targeted strikes against Houthi weapons depots or similar sites — which also have Iranian support — would cross a line and trigger a wider war.  ""We will continue to consult with international allies and partners on an appropriate way to protect commercial shipping going through that region, and at the same time ensuring we do what we need to do to protect our forces,"" said Ryder.

https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-strike-back-at-several-houthi-sites-in-yemen-/7436954.html,"  US, Britain Blast Dozens of Houthi Targets in Yemen in Retaliatory Strikes  ","      January 12, 2024 0:48 AM      ",  By Carla Babb  ,"  the pentagon —   The United States, Britain and a handful of other allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s capabilities.  U.S. Central Command late Thursday said the series of strikes hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.  ""We hit them pretty hard, pretty good,"" a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.  The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets, surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.  The U.S. alone, dropped more than 100 precision guided munitions on the Houthi installations, officials said, with the naval vessels and submarines firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out the intended targets.  The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.                In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden called the strikes a ""direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks"" on international shipping, saying they were necessary after attempts at diplomacy were ignored.  ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes,"" Biden said. ""I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.""  British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.  ""Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen,"" Sunak said in a statement. ""This cannot stand.""  It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following Hamas' assault on Israel on October 7.  U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the damage to Houthi capabilities is ""significant.""  ""We were going after very specific capability in very specific locations with precision munitions,"" said a senior U.S. military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the operation.  ""This was a significant action,"" added a senior U.S. administration official. ""[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent weeks.""  There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries, according to the U.S.  U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial ship full of jet fuel.  The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or damage.  On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.  U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels, responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.  The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.  Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S. officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described as reckless and illegal behavior.  ""There will be consequences,"" Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.  ""The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree. And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity,"" he said.  Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea continued.  ""Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,"" the statement said.  Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan.  The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.  Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden.  The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week called it ""the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea in years.""  The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday, calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.  There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do anything to deter Tehran.  ""Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground,"" the former commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.  ""They're choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a very low, very low price for Iran,"" he said.  But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.  ""I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe it stays in Yemen,"" he said. ""And I believe Iran will leave their partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate.""  U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than disinformation.  This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen's Red Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi's ability to track and target ships.

https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-sissi-to-discuss-israel-hamas-war/7435338.html,"  Blinken Wraps Up Latest Middle East Tour, Says Gaza Conflict Has to End  ","      January 11, 2024 1:21 AM        update    January 11, 2024 12:59 PM      ",  By Nike Ching  ,"  STATE DEPARTMENT —   U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday Israel working with Arab neighbors in the Middle East region to pave the way for a Palestinian state is the most effective way to isolate Iran.  Before leaving Cairo, where he held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Blinken said, “There’s a path that brings Israel’s needs and desires for integration in the region and genuine security with, as well, Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own.”  “That’s the single best way – this integration, security, a Palestinian state – to isolate and marginalize Iran and the kinds of actions it’s taking through its proxies,” Blinken said. “I think that vision is clear but for us to move on it, for it to really get started, the conflict in Gaza has to end. That’s critical.”  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has firmly rejected the two-state solution.  Cairo was the 10th and final stop on Blinken’s seven-day diplomatic mission, focused on containing the Gaza war, increasing humanitarian assistance, ensuring the protection of civilians, and securing the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas militants.  Earlier on Thursday, Blinken expressed appreciation for Egypt’s partnership in assisting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza.  “Secretary Blinken and President El Sissi discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages. The secretary reiterated U.S. commitment to ensuring Palestinians in Gaza are not forcibly displaced and to achieving regional peace that ensures Israel’s security and advances the establishment of a Palestinian state,” according to the State Department.  Egypt played a key role in mediating an earlier temporary cease-fire during which Hamas released more than 100 hostages and Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Egypt is trying to revive hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas.  Retired General Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, former commander of U.S. Central Command, expressed pessimism during a webinar on Wednesday.  ""I think it's going to be very hard to get the remaining hostages back. ... They're the last thing Hamas has,"" he said. ""I am not optimistic that we're going to get a lot of these hostages back.""

The Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian leaders issued a joint statement calling for the international community to maintain pressure for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and for the protection of Palestinian civilians. The leaders also highlighted the need for displaced Palestinians to be able to return to their homes in Gaza, and they rejected any attempt by Israel to reoccupy parts of the territory after the war.  Netanyahu said during televised remarks late Wednesday that Israel “has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”  ""Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law,"" he said.  Israel has agreed to allow a United Nations mission to evaluate the situation in war-ravaged northern Gaza for the safe return of displaced Palestinians.  Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Wednesday that the mission is ""contingent on security guarantees"" from Israel.  The U.N. hopes to carry it out as soon as possible, as it is critical to a planned increase in humanitarian aid for northern Gaza.  Diplomats said Israel has invited U.N. Security Council members to visit the country later this month.  A U.N. special envoy is also set to conduct a mission to Israel and the West Bank at the end of January to gather information on sexual violence against hostages, reportedly committed by Hamas militants during the October 7 attacks in southern Israel, and the aftermath.  More than 85% of Palestinians have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since October 7, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.  Red Sea attacks  Blinken on Wednesday warned of ""consequences"" after Yemen-based Houthi rebels launched their largest yet aerial attack on the Red Sea.  ""We had the biggest attack — UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] missiles — just yesterday,"" Blinken told reporters at Bahrain International Airport in Manama on Wednesday. ""These attacks have been aided and abetted by Iran with technology, equipment, intelligence, information, and they are having a real-life impact on people.""  More than 20 countries, including Bahrain, have pledged to preserve freedom of navigation and freedom of shipping in the Red Sea, Blinken said after holding talks with Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.  ""If these attacks continue as they did yesterday, there will be consequences,"" Blinken added. He urged Iran to stop its assistance to Houthis but declined to elaborate on what specific consequences there would be.  On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution condemning and demanding an end to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea.  The Iran-backed Houthis said the attacks target ships affiliated with or bound for Israel, and that they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.  Gaza health officials say more than 23,400 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.  Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel in October. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack.  Some material for this report came from Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.  "

John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, reiterated the administration’s long-standing position that a cease-fire at this point would only benefit Hamas.  Israel insists its military campaign will stop only after the U.S.-designated terror group is eliminated.

""The president wasn't signaling any change at all.""

Now!""  The incident is one of the most public demonstrations yet on how the conflict is dividing voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election in November.  Biden's statement is ""an insult"" to the American people who are ""demanding U.S. leadership"" to stop the war, said Wendy Pearlman, a professor of Middle East studies at Northwestern University.  ""It's almost embarrassing to talk about quiet, behind-the-scenes whispers when the Biden administration's actions on Israel speak so loudly,"" she told VOA, underscoring American financial, military and diplomatic support for Israel.  Pearlman is one of the more than 1,350 American political scientists who signed an open letter calling on Biden and other U.S. political leaders to press for an immediate cease-fire.  The administration has staunchly supported Israel's military operation in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization the U.S., U.K, EU and others.  According to the Gaza Health Ministry, Israel's campaign has killed more than 23,000 people in the Palestinian enclave — the bloodiest episode in the decadeslong conflict.                  Israeli soldiers take up positions near the Gaza Strip border, in southern Israel, Sunday, Jan.7, 2024.        Biden in a bind  With the scale of death and destruction rapidly increasing in Gaza, Biden, who is launching his reelection campaign, is in a bind, said Melani Cammett, professor of international affairs at Harvard University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies.  ""There still is a significant portion of the American public that is very strongly in support of the Israel-United States alliance and views any effort not to support Israel 100% as threatening to this alliance,"" she told VOA.  A poll by the Jewish Electorate Institute, an organization that describes itself as ""an independent, non-partisan organization"" dedicated to deepening understanding of Jewish American participation in U.S. democracy, shows three out of four Jewish American voters support Biden's handling of the war.  At the same time, Biden's policies on Israel are becoming a potential electoral liability among increasingly large swaths of voters beyond Arab and Muslim Americans, to include young and progressive Democrats, and even some in the American Jewish community.  On Monday, Americans for Peace Now, a left-wing, pro-Israel organization, became the first American Zionist group to call Israel to ""adopt and implement an immediate exit strategy from the war,"" a sign that American Jews' support for Israel may be fracturing.  ""The Biden administration must push Israel to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities and pivot from war to peacemaking,"" James Klutznick, the group's chairman, said in a statement.  Anti-Zionist and non-Zionist Jewish American groups have criticized Israel's conduct since the early stages of the conflict, but until APN's statement, the rest of the Jewish organizational spectrum had expressed support for Israel's war effort and Biden's support for the campaign.  ""The Jewish community is grateful for President Biden's efforts to stand by Israel in its response to Hamas's horrific attack on Oct. 7 and to stand with Jewish Americans as we face the rise of antisemitism,"" said Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, in a statement to VOA. JDCA aims to be ""the political home and voice of Jewish voters.""  ""Jewish voters also support President Biden's efforts to encourage the release of hostages, reduce the loss of life in Gaza, and ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance to innocent Palestinians,"" she added.  A December Gallup poll shows that 38% of Americans say Israel receives about the right amount of support, while 36% think it gets too much, and 24% say too little. Forty percent of Democrats and independents say the U.S. provides too much support for Israel, compared with 26% of Republicans.                         SEE ALSO:      Blinken: Israel Agrees on UN Mission to Evaluate North Gaza Situation            Another round of shuttle diplomacy  Biden's remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the Middle East for another round of shuttle diplomacy amid signs that the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is spreading to various hot spots across the region.  In one of his harshest rebukes to Israel, Blinken underscored that ""Israel must be a partner to Palestinian leaders"" in supporting ""a lasting solution that ends the long-running cycle of violence.""  Israel, he said, ""must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians' ability to govern themselves effectively.""  Beyond Washington's role, economic factors will be key in determining when Israel ends its campaign, said Michael Knights, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  ""There's a need to demobilize the huge reserves that have been mobilized since Oct. 7,"" Knights told VOA. ""There will actually, probably, be a moment in, let's say January or February, when the Israeli military says, 'We've done enough, and neither we nor the Americans can take any more political pressure. It's time for a cease-fire.'""  If Israel ends its high-intensity fighting in the first quarter, the war will cost around $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Israel's Finance Ministry. The number includes the cost of mobilizing 350,000 reserve soldiers.  The Biden administration's request for $14 billion to help Israel has been stalled in Congress.
